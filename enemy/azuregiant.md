## Quick Summary

Glowing Azure Giant is a mandatory boss on 15F that guards a key item used to unseal the way to Yukari. It's normally a very hard boss fight, with all the buffing it does to itself, but thanks to its 100 DTH resistance, we can use Komachi or Yuyuko paired with Reisen to kill it in one blow.
