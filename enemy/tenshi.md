## Quick Summary

Tenshi is a mandatory boss blocking the stairs to 7F. This fight is one of those mandatory losses, even though it's technically possible to beat Tenshi in the time limit, giving you a Divine Barrier as reward. We don't bother with that for the speedrun though, since killing her consistently is really really hard.

The strategy here is to waste 10 of her turns as fast as possible. Let things die and keep swapping things in so they too can die. Use Concentrate whenever you're not swapping people since it has the highest delay. Surely you can count up to 10 to know when you're safe.
