## Quick Summary

Kraken is a mandatory boss fight to recruit Orin. We opt to avoid this fight until we finish exploring the next floor, so that we can come back to it by the challenge level. It is possible to do this fight underlevelled, but it is very inconsistent thanks to the Kraken's high offensive power. The high SHK chance on half of its moveset is also very annoying.
