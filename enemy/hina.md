## Quick Summary

Hina is a mandatory boss blocking the stairs to 6F. She is very strong and very defensive, and trying to cheese her fight with ailments or debuffs results in her buffing herself to frightening levels. Thus, the most reliable way to damage her is via PSN, and just have someone with high HP/MND tank the hits while PSN does its thing.
