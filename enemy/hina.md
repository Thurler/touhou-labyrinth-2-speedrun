## Quick Summary

Hina is a mandatory boss blocking the stairs to 6F. She is very strong and very defensive, and trying to cheese her fight with ailments or debuffs results in her buffing herself to frightening levels. Thus, the most reliable way to damage her is via PSN, and just have someone with high HP/MND tank the hits while PSN does its thing.

Hina is an incredibly difficult foe since we have no reliable way to fight her "honestly" with raw power. She just hits too hard and there's no reliable way to damage her for lots of damage like we did with Komachi. Her biggest threat is having a 50% chance to cast AoE spells on phase 1, and 68% on phase 2, not to mention the 6% chance to just wall you entirely with fresh buffs on her. Our only reliable way to kill her is via PSN, waiting for it to tick damage while Parsee tanks everything with 800+ MND.

Parsee can take any hit with 0 damage so long as Hina is not buffed, and will take a decent chunk of damage if she isn't buffed after Hina buffs herself. This is all thanks to library bonus, level up bonus and FIR affinity equipment. Reimu is very important here to reapply the MND bonus on Parsee soon before Hina procs her buffs on herself. Parsee must carefully time her switches so that Reimu and Wriggle can come in, do their thing, then immediately get switched back out before Hina takes another turn. Around 6000 ATB is a safe range for unbuffed Hina, and buffed Hina is never safe, so don't bother. It's better to wait for buff decay than to risk losing Reimu or Wriggle.

Komachi can be swapped in on occasion to deal some big damage with Scythe that Chooses the Dead, which targets Hina's weakness. Komachi is far from the best damage dealer, but 2 casts of StCtD should match a Super Scope in damage output here. Crucially, however, is the fact that Komachi cannot be faster than Parsee - at best, she can match her SPD. Because of this, Parsee should stay at slot 2, and swap in Komachi into slot 1. This way, they gain the same ATB ticks and Komachi takes a turn before Parsee, so she can switch Komachi out.

One important quirk with her AI that Parsee can exploit: if Parsee casts Midnight Anathema Ritual right after Biorhythm, Spinning Around More than Usual takes priority over Curse Reversal, so she will choose to buff herself instead of reverse her debuffs, which will result in very mild buffs (no more than 10%) compared to the full 30%. This can also help Parsee take less damage. The chance to proc TRR/SIL is 66%, and thus the chance that at least one procs is 88.44%, so make sure you hit that Anathema Ritual before Curse Reversal.

After the second Biorhythm and after some buff decay, swap in Nitori when she's at about 25% HP to nuke her with Super Scope 3D and try to snipe the kill. If she survives, PSN can tick her to 1 HP for anyone to finish her off. Reimu also deals good damage thanks to Hina's SPI weakness. The party composition is the following, listing only important characters:

Front: Parsee / Rumia / Reimu / Wriggle

Back: Marisa / Keine / Nitori / Komachi

Should be noted that Rumia, Marisa and Keine are used as sacrifices so Parsee is left solo in the frontlines. This saves on turn time since there will be less menuing and concentrating to do. Marisa and Rumia can deal chip damage too with her spells while they don't die. Keine can further boost Parsee's buffs with Three Treasures - Mirror. The fight is then divided into three phases, detailed below:

**PHASE 1 - First Turn**

The goal here is for Wriggle to proc her PSN, Reimu buff Parsee and have both switch out for the sacrifices. If Wriggle dies to Hina's first spell, you must reset. The chance for that to happen is only around 40% if you're unlucky with dodges and damage rolls.

* Wriggle uses Comet on Earth
* Reimu uses Great Hakurei Border
* Swap Reimu for Marisa, Wriggle for Keine
* Parsee spams Concentrate
* Keine spams Three Treasures - Mirror until death
* Rumia spams Moonlight Ray until death
* Marisa uses Master Spark

**PHASE 2 - PSN Spam**

After Parsee is soloing the front line, she needs to manipulate her ATB to sync up with Hina's, so she can safely switch in Reimu and Wriggle to reapply buffs and PSN, respectively. This goes on until Hina's HP is around 25%.

* Parsee swaps in Reimu/Wriggle if Hina ATB <6000
* Immediately swaps them out after they use their move
* Use Midnight Anathema Ritual after Misfortune God's Biorhythm

**PHASE 3 - Sniping the Kill**

With Hina's HP down to 25%, swap in other characters and when Hina's ATB allows for a safe switch-in, just swap in Nitori for the kill.

* Swap in other characters until Hina's ATB is <6000 on a turn
* Swap in Nitori and Super Scope 3D
* Komachi and Scythe that Chooses the Dead is another option
* Use whatever you have to finish her off if she survives Scope
