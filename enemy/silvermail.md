## Quick Summary

Silver Mail is one of the 10F FOE you can choose to fight. It guards the Herbalist's Proof, a very important subclass that gives access to Herb of Awakening, the strongest Boost buff in the game. The boss has 0 SHK resistance, so it's trivial to keep it permanently stunned if you have enough SPD and luck. The boss is weak to FIR, so spamming a move with that element alongside a SHK spell is the way to go.

Since it is so easy to keep the boss in permanent SHK, we spam Rin's Cat Walk to keep applying SHK on it. For damage, since we show up overlevelled for this, just spam Nitori's and Chen's stronger spells. The strategy is to basically 1-2 turn it:

* Rin spams Cat's Walk
* Nitori spams Super Scope 3D
* Kasen spams Higekiri's Cursed Arm
* Chen uses Kimontonkou then spams Phoenix Spread Wings
