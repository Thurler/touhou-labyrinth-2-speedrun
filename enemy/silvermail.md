## Quick Summary

Silver Mail is one of the 10F FOE you can choose to fight. It guards the Herbalist's Proof, a very important subclass that gives access to Herb of Awakening, the strongest Boost buff in the game. The boss has 0 SHK resistance, so it's trivial to keep it permanently stunned if you have enough SPD and luck. The boss is weak to FIR, so spamming a move with that element alongside a SHK spell is the way to go.

Since we only need Herbalist's buffs for the Yuuka fight, we skip this fight and only return to it when we are overlevelled, meaning we can ignore any gimmicks and just kill it in two casts of Nitori's Super Scope, accelerated by Aya's Divine Grandson's Advent.
