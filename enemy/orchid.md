## Quick Summary

Blue Orchid is a mandatory boss fight to recruit Utsuho. This fight is easily cheesed with the HVY ailment, since it halves the boss' DEF from an absurd 3600 down to a more manageable 1800. Normally you would need to wait for it to shed its DEF, but we can ignore that and just hit it until it dies anyway with its defense halved.
