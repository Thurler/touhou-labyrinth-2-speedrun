## Quick Summary

The Magatama of Amber Fangs is a necessary boss to unlock the final part of 12F. With absurdly high defenses, it should be an extremely tough fight to do underlevelled. However, note it only has 100 DTH resistance. Reisen's Intense Vertigo drops that to 80, allowing some characters to proc DTH on it, completely trivializing this fight.

As mentioned in the summary, the strat is to proc DTH on this thing before it can even move. We use Komachi to do this, since she's the only one in this route that has access to high DTH skills. Ferriage in the Deep Fog at level 5 has a 64% chance to DTH, and stacked with 25% from The Shinigami's Work, that gives us a 9% chance to proc DTH on the Mirror. We use Aya, Komachi and Reisen to achieve this:

* Aya uses DGA on Komachi
* Komachi tries Ferriage in the Deep Fog #1
* Aya uses Sarutahiko's Guidance on herself
* Komachi tries Ferriage in the Deep Fog #2
* Aya uses DGA on Komachi
* Komachi tries Ferriage in the Deep Fog #3
