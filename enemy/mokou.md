## Quick Summary

Mokou is an optional boss fight that continues the Eientei side quest. She has access to many powerful moves and will regenerate HP every turn, on top of reviving after death to spam her nuke right in your face. The fight would be really hard if not for the fact we get there overlevelled, so it ends up being a breeze.
