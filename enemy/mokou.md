## Quick Summary

Mokou is an optional boss fight that continues the Eientei side quest. She has access to many powerful moves and will regenerate HP every turn, on top of reviving after death to spam her nuke right in your face. The fight would be really hard if not for the fact we get there overlevelled, so it ends up being a breeze.

Since we show up overlevelled for this fight, it's very easy to overwhelm Mokou with Nitori and Kasen, all thanks to her CLD and WND weakness. Keine stays around to buff those two, and Komachi to absorb damage and try to spread some debuffs. The only way this fight can go wrong is if no one dodges Fujiyama Volcano and Kasen's Guts doesn't proc, in which case you might full wipe. The fight is kinda fast though so it's not a big time loss. The flowchart is basically:

* Komachi spams Narrow Confines of Avici to get debuffs
* Kasen spams Diving Waltz of the Raijuu for damage and possible PAR (40%)
* Nitori spams Kappa's Waterfall for big damage and possible DEF-debuff (40%)
* Keine spams Three Treasures - Sword to buff everyone
* After Fujiyama Volcano, Marisa can come in to Master Spark
