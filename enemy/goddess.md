## Quick Summary

Black Goddess of Fertility is a mandatory boss on 16F, guarding the key item that unlocks the second half of 17F. The boss regenerates around 100k HP every turn it gets, which would make this fight a pain to deal with if not for the power of Diva Aya. Technically Aya doesn't even need to Diva, since Nitori can 2shot the boss, but it helps with consistency.
