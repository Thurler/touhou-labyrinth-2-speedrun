## Quick Summary

The Golden Orb Trio is a mandatory boss on 18F, guarding the stairs to 19F. It consists of three enemy orbs, each with an easily exploitable weakness and all are vulnerable to Diva Aya. Forward Time is weak to PHY, Canopy to NTR and Reverse Time to DTH, making Yuyuko and Nitori extremely useful here.
