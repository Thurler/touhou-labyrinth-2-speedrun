## Quick Summary

Yuyuko is a mandatory boss on 14F that unlocks a rock seal guarding the way to Yukari on 15F. Using a variety of DTH inducing moves, this fight can be very unreliable when it comes to speedrunning, but thankfully she's weak to TRR, and by this point we can stack TRR with Yuuka/Satori, which is way more reliable when doing this fight underleveled.
