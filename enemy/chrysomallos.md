## Quick Summary

Chrysomallos is the first FOE you will face in the game, but unlike Etrian Odyssey, it is easily dealt with even when you're underlevelled. For the speedrun, we absolutely need to defeat it since doing so lets us unlocks Nitori, who wrecks the entire game with her broken skills. So we go out of our way to make sure we kill this thing, specially since Kasen and Marisa make short work of it thanks to the DRK and MYS weakness.

The main offensive characters in this fight are Kasen and Marisa, but Reimu and Rumia can come in to help deal some damage if something unexpected happens. Defensively, Momiji and Kasen should tank the hits. Keine does the offensive buffing, and Reimu the defensive one. Cirno can slow the boss down with Icicle Fall since it has 0 SPD debuff resistance, but generally isn't necessary.

Front: Momiji / Kasen / Keine / Reimu

Back: Marisa / Rumia / Cirno

* Momiji attacks to delay her turn
* Kasen spams Higekiri's Cursed Arm for massive DRK damage
* Keine spams Three Sacred Treasures - Sword
* Reimu uses Great Hakurei Barrier once
* Momiji swaps Reimu for Marisa then spams Rabies Bite
* Marisa uses her self MAG buff twice
* Marisa concentrates to refill the exact 6MP used for buffing
* Marisa uses Master Spark
	* If Marisa got TRR'd, spam Magic Missile instead
	* If Marisa dies:
		* Swap in Rumia and spam Moonlight Ray
* If Kasen/Keine run out of MP:
	* Swap for Reimu, who uses Fantasy Seal

This should kill Chrysomallos very fast and reliably. Marisa avoiding the TRR from Great Roar allows for a quick and easy fight with Master Spark, otherwise it will take a few more turns but it's still very manageable. Reimu and Rumia can deal big damage to finish the boss off if needed, thanks to SPI and MYS weaknesses. It's unlikely, but the boss can target slot 4 with regular attack and kill Marisa, which will slow down the fight but is generally fine. Kasen may also die during the fight if the boss targets her multiple times with regular attack, but Reimu can come in to replace her, even though the fight will slow down considerably.
