We actually show up at exactly the challenge level here, so this fight ends up being easy, but not completely free like the previous ones in the Eientei side quest. The fight is surprisingly simple, thanks to Nitori and Kasen being completely overpowered:

* Kasen spams Higekiri's Cursed Arm
* Nitori uses Portable Machine 3 times, then Super Scope 3D
* Keine spams Three Treasures - Sword
* Momiji stays PAR'd hopefully

The Wasp does not have enough power to kill Momiji or anyone else, so unless you get very unlucky with Paralysis Fog, you'll always win this.
