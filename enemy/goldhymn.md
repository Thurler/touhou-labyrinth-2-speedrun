## Quick Summary

Gold Hymn is one of the 10F FOE you can choose to fight. It guards a Stone of Awakening, so it is highly recommended that you kill this as soon as possible no matter which category you're playing, since subclasses are extremely important. The boss only has 33 PAR resistance, so it is very easy to keep it in permanent PAR with the likes of Kasen, and then nuke it with strong CLD spells to kill it fast.

Since it is so easy to keep the boss in permanent PAR, we spam Kasen's Diving Waltz of the Raijuu to keep applying PAR on it. For damage, we spam Nitori's Kappa's Waterfall. To speed up the fight considerably, we add in Keine for AoE ATK buffing, and Aya for SPD buffing and turn manipulation. The strategy basically boils down to:

* Aya uses Divine Grandson's Advent on Kasen
* Kasen spams Diving Waltz of the Raijuu
* Nitori spams Kappa's Waterfall
* Keine spams 3 Sacred Treasures - Sword
* Aya buffs SPD and uses DGA as needed
