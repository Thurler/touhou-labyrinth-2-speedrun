## Quick Summary

Memorized Knowledge is a mandatory boss on 14F, guarding the key item to access the second half of 13F that leads into the deeper parts of the fire stratum. It follows a very simple pattern that is easy to work around, and it being weak to PHY, DRK and TRR makes Nitori and Parsee very useful here for dealing damage.
