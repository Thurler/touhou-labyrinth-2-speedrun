## Quick Summary

Memorized Knowledge is a mandatory boss on 14F, guarding the key item to access the second half of 13F that leads into the deeper parts of the fire stratum. It follows a very simple pattern that is easy to work around, and it being weak to PHY, DRK and TRR makes Nitori and Parsee very useful here for dealing damage.

This fight requires very careful planning to make Nitori survive an Ether Flare, and after tanking that first hit just blasting Memorized Knowledge with damage before it can even cast MAG UP again. Sometimes TRR won't proc, which can make this a bit unreliable, but Nitori can easily tank another Ether Flare since she gets fully healed after the first one, thanks to Reimu's Final Prayer. For damage, we focus on Parsee, Kasen, Chen and Nitori as they are the more reliable PHY/DRK damage dealers.

The plan at the start of the fight is to prepare for Ether Flare, and if you get lucky with TRR, get some damage in. We get Aya to buff Sanae's SPD, as her job is to make sure Parsee is maxing out on damage. Aya then swaps herself for Reisen to improve our odds at sticking TRR to the boss, using Parsee's Grudge Returning. We use that instead of Midnight Anathema Ritual since we care more about TRR sticking rather than its duration. Reisen can chip some debuffs on the boss, and if TRR from Grudge Returning proc'd, Parsee can fire one Jealousy of the Kind before Ether Flare.

The setup for Ether Flare is to sack 3 characters and get Nitori to survive. The lineup we use for that is Nitori/Reimu/Cirno/Iku. Reimu is only there to provide Final Prayer so Nitori can tank a second Ether Flare, if needed. Similarly, Cirno's only purpose is to proc Blizzard Blowout and get Memorized Knowledge stuck in a very, very slow state. Iku tries to sneak in a Elekiter Dragon Palace before dying, so that Parsee can maximize her damage, but it's not going to make much of a difference, what with the boss only having 100 DEF.

After tanking an Ether Flare (thanks to massive HP and MYS investment), Nitori swaps in Chen, who swaps in Sanae and Parsee. The goal of the fight then becomes inflicting TRR with Parsee (60% chance) and capitalizing on it with Jealousy of the Kind. It's important that Reisen is in whenever you go for a TRR proc, and Sanae should be constantly buffing Parsee. Chen can be used to AI pivot Sanae and Parsee, and Nitori can sneak in a 3D Super Scope whenever she's no longer needed (remember her ATB goes to 0 after casting that).

If Parsee is out of MP and can't finish the job without concentrating, Kasen and Chen can also deal very reliable damage to Memorized Knowledge, make sure to buff them with Sanae to fully optimize how much damage you're dealing. The ideal fight doesn't even see a second MAG UP, and if you need to tank a second Ether Flare, make sure Nitori is by herself in the frontline.

**PHASE 1 - Preparation**

The goal here is to prepare some buffs, debuffs, and the frontline for Ether Flare:

* Aya buffs Sanae SPD twice
* Sanae spams Miracle Fruit on Parsee
* Aya switches self for Reisen
* Nitori IA pivots Sanae
* Parsee uses Grudge Returning
* Reisen spams Discarder
* If TRR proc'd:
  * Nitori swaps Sanae with Cirno
  * Parsee uses Jealousy of the Kind and Lovely
* Form Change into Nitori / Iku / Reimu / Cirno

**PHASE 2 - Quick Kill**

Rushdown with Parsee, then Kasen and Chen if necessary. Keep buffs up and IA pivot whenever needed:

* Nitori swaps in Chen, who swaps in Parsee
* Parsee concentrates
* Nitori swaps in Sanae
* Chen swaps self with Reisen
* Sanae spams Miracle Fruit on Parsee
* Nitori and Reisen IA pivot Sanae and Parsee
* Parsee uses Grudge Returning
* If TRR does not proc:
  * Concentrate -> Grudge Returning until proc
* Parsee uses Jealousy of the Kind and Lovely
* At low HP, Nitori, Kasen and Chen finish
