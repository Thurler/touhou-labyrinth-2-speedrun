## Quick Summary

Tenshi acts as the third stratum's boss, and this time you actually need to beat her. Her second form is another mandatory loss though. Tenshi has an absurd DEF/MND count, making her very hard to damage reliably, so debuffs and defense ignoring spells are the way to victory. Her AI can be very easily manipulated to spam the same attack over and over, but you'll need a very powerful tank to take the nuke on every turn Tenshi gets. Defeatng her second form is unreliable, but if you manage to do it the game rewards you with a Lilium's Panties.

The real fight with Tenshi requires a very specific setup to be done at such a low level. Since she has a lot of DEF and MND the only reliable damage source are spells that penetrate her defenses, and the only one capable of doing that is Iku with her skills. It is technically possible to damage her by keeping her debuffed and HVY/SIL, but that is considerably slower than just spamming Iku's attacks that can fully penetrate Tenshi's defenses.

Iku can ignore all of her MND if she has a 50% debuff on her, thanks to Heavenly Maiden's Blow, but that is not very reliable since the debuff wears off with time, needing to be reapplied constantly. If we instead use her Normal Attack, we can make it ignore 80% of Tenshi's MND by using the Hagoromo Like Sky skill, and then boost her damage by applying the Sorcerer subclass' Enhanced Normal Attack skill. Other boosts in damage can come from Mind and Body as One (+10%), also from Sorcerer subclass, and Marisa's Magic Training skill (+30%), allowing Iku to easily deal over 3k damage per regular attack with minimal buffs.

In order to integrate Marisa into the frontline, we subclass her as an Enchanter, so that she can spam Art of the Battlemage on Iku to keep her offense strong. There are better buffs out there, but we need Marisa for the big 30% damage boost. Sanae can also buff Iku with Miracle Fruit or Last Wish, if we manage to KO her consistently.

Defensively, Tenshi can be a pain to deal with, featuring spells that slow you down, inflict PAR, or just randomly target slots 3 and 4 for no reason with her nukes. Thankfully, we can manipulate her AI into getting stuck with Sword of Hisou on slot 1, not only allowing Iku to stay buffed, but also keeping everyone from harm. To do that, though, we need to put Nitori as a Guardian and buff her HP and DEF to levels where she can tank at least 2 Swords of Hisou, and having an Intama to raise her SPI affinity by 200 greatly helps, too. Now all we need is a dedicated healer and the front line is settled for victory.

Nitori / Minoriko / Marisa / Iku is the front line we'll be using for most of the fight to damage Iku. Minoriko has enough MAG to fully heal Nitori and her healing spell does not have that much delay. She can also buff Nitori with very little delay, which is always a plus in case Sword of Hisou removes too many buffs. Other useful characters include Sanae, Aya and Reisen. Sanae buffs Iku with Miracle Fruit until she dies, triggering Last Wish and further buffing Iku to 100% in all stats. Aya can help at the start by boosting everyone's SPD to complete the setup before Tenshi gets a second turn. Reisen can reduce Tenshi's MND buff from State of Enlightenment, which helps Iku deal just a bit more damage. The three phases in this fight are described below:

* **Phase 1 - Sacrifice**

Our initial line up is Sanae / Minoriko / Aya / Reisen. Aya buffs Minoriko's SPD so she can get enough turns before Tenshi's second turn. Her passive SPD boost and Minoriko's passive MAG boost for the fronlines also helps stack some buffs on Sanae so she can be targeted by Sword of Hisou. Reisen debuffs Tenshi's MND and tries to proc SIL (66%) to further drop it for Iku. The frontline is swapped to the main one, and Sanae buffs Iku before she takes a OHKO from Swod of Hisou.

* Aya buffs Minoriko SPD twice
* Minoriko swaps Aya for Iku
* Reisen uses Lunatic Red Eyes
* Sanae uses Miracle Fruit on Iku
* Minoriko swaps Reisen for Marisa
* Iku uses Attack
* Minoriko uses Owotoshi Harvester on Sanae
* Sanae dies to Sword of Hisou, triggering Last Wish

* **Phase 2 - Concentrate**

At this point, Nitori is swapped in and the main cycle begins. She needs to receive a buff from Minoriko and activate her self buff at least once, otherwise Tenshi will kill Minoriko with Sword of Hisou. From then on you need to make sure Nitori buffs herself, Minoriko heals her, and Marisa buffs Iku as much as she can. Iku spams her normal attack until Tenshi gets into the Concentrate threshold, when you need to swap the frontline to characters that can survive Wild Dance. We swap in Reimu so she can use her Armored Yin-Yang Orb to soften the hit, reducing damage by 30%, and Komachi, who has a bunch of HP and high SPI affinity. After that we go back to the regular damage cycle.

* Marisa swaps in Nitori
* Iku spams Attack
* Nitori spams Portable Versatile Machine / Concentrate
* Minoriko juggles Nitori's buffs and heals
* Marisa spams Art of the Battlemage on Iku
* On concentrate, make lineup Nitori / Reimu / Komachi

* **Phase 3 - State of Enlightenment**

When Tenshi reuses State of Enlightenment, we swap in Reisen to use Lunatic Red Eyes again, and then resume the same strategy we used for phase 2. As Tenshi nears death, you can swap Minoriko with Rumia to further add a 20% boost to Iku's damage, thanks to her Youkai's Knowledge skill. After Tenshi dies, just swap in your weakest characters to die on her enhanced phase.

* Repeat phase 2 loop until State of Enlightenment
* Swap Marisa for Reisen so she can debuff MND with LRE
* Swap Marisa back and repeat phase 2
