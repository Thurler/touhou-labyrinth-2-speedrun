## Quick Summary

Yuuka is an optional boss on 8F that is unlocked when you reach 13F, after seeing a bunch of BP events throughout the dungeon. Yuuka is mandatory to use TRR stacking, so we tend to use her a lot. Her fight can be very hard to deal with, thanks to her ability to heal every 3 turns. If you can damage rush her into Master Spark range though, it's an easy win.

Yuuka is very strong and very fast with a very high HP count, but what truly makes her stand out from other tanky bosses is her ability to heal herself for 25k every 3 turns while also dealing massive NTR damage to you in the process. She is thankfully weak to CLD, so Nitori can make short work of her HP with the appropriate investment and skills, dealing over 30k damage per hit.

**PHASE 1 - Blizzard Blowout**

The first objective of the fight is to slow Yuuka down so that her DPS lowers considerably and we get more time between her turns, which delays her heal. We can achieve this with Cirno and her Blizzard Blowout skill, fully debuffing her 256 SPD down to 128 when the fairy is KO'd. While Yuuka doesn't take the fairy bait, we leave Kourin and Sanae buffing Kasen, who deals some chip damage with Higekiri's Cursed Arm.

* Wait for Cirno to die, spam Icicle Fall
* Sanae juggles Miracle Fruit on Kasen and heals
* Kasen spams Higekiri's Cursed Arm
* Kourin spams Battle Command on Kasen

**PHASE 2 - Damage Rush**

After the SPD debuff is applied, Nitori and Minoriko swap in, to cram in as much damage as possible before her DPS overwhelms the party. Nitori gets buffed by Sanae's Miracle Fruit, Kourin's Battle Command and Minoriko's Art of the Battlemage as an Enhancer. She can boost her own damage with Ability to Manipulate Water (+30%), Overheating (+15% per stack) and Minoriko's Symbol of Harvest (+20%). After enough buffs are applied, aya can join in to give her more turns.

* Swap in Minoriko where Cirno was
* Minoriko juggles heals, buffs and switches
* Swap Kasen with Nitori
* Sanae spams Miracle Fruit on Nitori
* Nitori spams Kappa Waterfall
* Occasionally swap Sanae with Aya
* Aya DGAs Nitori with good timing

**PHASE 3 - Master Spark**

With the appropriate ATK hyperinvesting, Nitori can easily deal 30k damage per hit, snowballing to 50-70k after some Overheat stacks. This should be enough to put Yuuka into her Master Spark phase, when she'll be vulnerable to receive all damage without having to worry about DPS. If the DPS won't be enough, one can SHK her to prevent Master Spark from coming out, but in this route we have enough DPS to skip right past that. If all else fails, Kasen might survive it with Guts.

* Damage rush with Nitori and Kasen
* If Master Spark is inevitable, tank with Kasen Guts
