## Quick Summary

Yuuka is an optional boss on 8F that is unlocked when you reach 13F, after seeing a bunch of BP events throughout the dungeon. Yuuka is mandatory to use TRR stacking, so we tend to use her a lot. Her fight can be very hard to deal with, thanks to her ability to heal every 3 turns. If you can damage rush her into Master Spark range though, it's an easy SHK win.
