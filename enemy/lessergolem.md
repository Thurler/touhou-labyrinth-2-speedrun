## Quick Summary

The Lesser Golem is an FOE guarding the area with Chen and a few treasures, and is quite powerful physically, both in offense and defense. Since it is entirely optional like every FOE, we come back to face it when we are already overlevelled.

Since we show up completely overlevelled here, we simply nuke it with whatever strong spells we have here. Stuff like Kasen's Higekiri Cursed Arm and Nitori's Super Scope 3D make short work of it, despite it having very high DEF.
