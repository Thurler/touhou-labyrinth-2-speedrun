## Quick Summary

Iku blocks your way to the second half of stratum 3, and packs a bunch of very powerful spells that can easily overwhelm an unprepared party. Since she mostly focuses on WND spells, planning your team to resist that element is crucial, and Aya can help a lot with her Ability to Manipulate Wind. She is very weak to NTR, so just like in the Komachi fight, Nitori is the best candidate for damage dealing. Her low SIL resistance also allows her to drop some of her power if you manage to proc that. Overall though, Iku is very fast and very powerful, so a lot of setup is done to fight her.

There's a lot of setup before the fight to maximize our damage output. The key characters for this fight defensively are Parsee, Aya and Sanae. Reimu also plays a small role using her AoE buff and heal on an emergency. Parsee is the main tank and switcher, since she barely takes any damage from Iku's attacks. Aya helps mitigate damage with her Ability to Manipulate Wind, though she can't take more than a few hits before dying. Sanae plays the role of main buffer and healer, and acts as a secondary tank since her WND affinity and MND stat are high enough to tank several hits.

Offensively, Nitori, Kasen and Chen do a very solid job. Early on Kasen can debuff Iku's SPD with Higekiri's Cursed Arm, though it's not too reliable since there's only a 50% chance to proc. We use it mostly as our first damage source for 3k-5k damage per hit. Nitori gets buffed early on and then is dragged in by the time the damage race starts, dealing 7k+ per hit depending on her buff status, thanks to the added 20% bonus from Kappa's Ecology Observation. Chen can act as a final source of damage with Instant Attack + Kimontonkou after Iku debuffs her own DEF.

Iku's basic spells offer little to no threat with the lineup used, unless you get very unlucky with targetting and she repeatedly PARs Sanae or Kasen. After her buff, however, every spell can kill anyone that isn't Parsee, so be careful when her turn approaches during the damage rush. The first Light Dragon's Sigh will completely assassinate everyone, except for Parsee and Sanae. Aya can survive as well and mitigate damage to those 2, assuming she is at full HP. The fight is separated into 4 phases, detailed below:

**PHASE 1 - Buffing**

The main goal at the start of the fight is to buff Nitori before Iku stats piling up damage. This will allow us to swap in Nitori later to deal obscene amounts of damage with no buffing later on. Aya buffs Reimu's and Sanae's SPD so they can more easily cast their buffs and recover from PAR. Keine comes in to help buff Nitori along ith Sanae, ideally setting Nitori's ATK to >70% buff. Swap Nitori with Kasen to begin the damage phase.

* Aya buffs Reimu and Sanae
* Reimu uses Great Hakurei Barrier
* Swap Reimu with Keine, Aya with Nitori
* Buff Nitori for a while until her ATK is over 70%
	* Sanae uses Miracle Fruit to buff
	* Keine uses Three Treasures - Sword to buff
	* Nitori can buff herself with Portable Versatile Machine
* Swap Nitori with Kasen

**PHASE 2 - Kasen**

Next we want to deal as much damage with Kasen as possible. We buff her just like we did Nitori and just spam Higekiri's Cursed Arm, hoping for SPD debuffs. Sanae must heal whoever gets PAR'd or too debuffed, and Parsee can help by Instant Attack pivoting with Chen. If there's nothing better to do, Parsee can try to proc SIL on Iku with Midnight Anathema Ritual (42%).

* Kasen spams Higekiri's Cursed Arm
* Keine spams Three Treasures - Sword
* Sanae juggles Miracle Fruit on Kasen and heals
* Parsee tries to proc SIL with Midnight Anathema Ritual
* Parsee also switches Chen with whoever needs IA pivoting

**PHASE 3 - Light Dragon's Sigh**

When Kasen runs out of MP, depending on how much damage was dealt there will still be time to do a small damage rush, but you need to be ready to back out of it if it turns out she was already below 55% HP. Aya swaps in where Keine was, and Kourin where Kasen was. They will then swap in Nitori so she can spam Extending Arm as much as possible before Light Dragon's Sigh. Kourin can swap her in with 9100 ATB, and Aya can make her act twice with Divine Grandson's Advent. Kourin may die to LDS, but certainly not Nitori, so make sure she's not there when Iku gets a turn.

* Swap Keine with Aya, Kasen with Kourin
* Put Nitori in slot 4 to attack with Extending Arm
* Aya can Divine Grandson's Advent her for another hit
* Parsee switches her out, Kourin back in
* Lineup Parsee/Aya/Komachi/Sanae for Light Dragon's Sigh

**PHASE 4 - Whiskers of the Dragon God**

After LDS, depending on how much HP is left, you may choose to either play it safe by switching in Reimu for healing, or just swap in Nitori, Kasen and Chen to finish her off. The fact that she debuffs all of her defenses also helps immensely to do it before she kills you with her now impossibly high SPD.

* Swap in Reimu so she can use Exorcising Border
* Swap Kourin back in to damage rush with Nitori
* Chen and Kasen deal massive damage now that she is debuffed
* Improvise until you win
