## Quick Summary

Iku blocks your way to the second half of stratum 3, and packs a bunch of very powerful spells that can easily overwhelm an unprepared party. Since she mostly focuses on WND spells, planning your team to resist that element is crucial, and Aya can help a lot with her Ability to Manipulate Wind. She is very weak to NTR, so just like in the Komachi fight, Nitori is the best candidate for damage dealing. Her low SIL resistance also allows her to drop some of her power if you manage to proc that. Overall though, Iku is very fast and very powerful, so a lot of setup is done to fight her.

There's a lot of setup before the fight to maximize our damage output. The key characters in the fight are Sanae, Reimu, Aya, Chen, Wriggle, Nitori and Satori. The only offensive member is Nitori, everyone else is playing the support role here.

Wriggle inflicts PSN at the start of the fight, to deal passive damage as we setup Nitori for success. The chance to proc with a maxed out Comet on Earth is 88%, so it is very reliable. Aya will setup Wriggle to act first at the start of the fight, making sure we maximize our PSN damage.

Nitori is the central piece of the fight, boasting Maintenance and Overheating to increase her damage output exponentially as the fight goes on. She will spam regular attack until she gets 5 stacks of Overheat, and then unleash 2 fully powered Extending Arms, which should kill Iku from around 60% with the proper buffs and skills in place. If the fight goes well, we don't even see her threshold moves.

Sanae, Reimu and Aya work together to buff Nitori as much as possible while Overheat stacks up. Sanae can spam Miracle Fruit, Reimu can dish out heals and defensive buffs to keep everyone alive in Iku's first phase. Aya can swap Reimu and Sanae around via IA pivoting, that's where Chen can come in to help. Aya can also distribute SPD buffs on turns when she doesn't have anyone to IA pivot.

Now talking about skills to help Nitori get the 2 hit kill, Sanae brings Youkai Buster Lv2 for a 20% boost, and Satori brings Trauma Recollection Lv2 for another 24% boost. Defensively, Aya has Ability to Manipulate Wind to help mitigate WND damage from Iku, which helps increase survivability. Sometimes Iku will target slots 3/4 and kill Aya/Nitori, or you'll get unlucky with PAR and Reimu will be unable to heal. Depending on how early on these things happen, it's still possible to finish the setup, as long as Nitori is alive.

When it's time to go for the kill, Satori comes in and can copy Sanae's Miracle Fruit for further healing. Aya can DGA Nitori for extra turns, and dish out SPD buffs in case the turns don't exactly line up for the kill. If for some reason Iku lives and you eat a Light Dragon's Sigh, assuming you survive, you can pick up the kill with Kasen and Chen, so don't give up! A quick breakdown of the fight would go like this:

* **PHASE 1 - PSN + Buffing**
	* Aya DGA on Wriggle, uses Comet on Earth
	* Wriggle swaps self for Reimu
	* Sanae spams Miracle Fruit on Nitori
	* Nitori spams regular attack to build Overheat
	* Reimu and Aya juggle buff/heals with IA pivot
* **PHASE 2 - Overheat 5 Kill**
	* Swap Reimu with Satori
	* Nitori Extending Arm
	* Aya DGA Nitori
	* Nitori Extending Arm
	* Sanae and Satori buff Nitori if possible
* **PHASE 3 - Emergency**
	* If not dead and someone lived, swap in Kasen and Chen
	* Spam Higekiri's Cursed Arm
	* Spam Kimontonkou + PSW
