## <a id="achievement-list"></a>Achievement List

* 001 - Win 50 Battles (Manga Meat)
* 002 - Win 200 Battles (Treasure Chest Key)
* 003 - Win 1000 Battles (Treasure Chest Key)
* 004 - Win 3000 Battles (Training Manual x2)
* P03 - Win 10000 Battles (Spartan's Tome - Attack)

These will all happen naturally as you play the game and grind. The rewards are pretty good, keys are very important and manuals are always welcome to boost a character that doesn't gain as many levels as you need.

* 005 - Escape 20 Battles (Swiftness Gem)
* 006 - Escape 200 Battles (Swiftness Gem x2)

These will happen naturally after you begin fleeing from encounters due to already being at the target level. The rewards aren't that great, but this is super low effort, too.

* 007 - Game Over once (100 Money)
* 008 - Game Over 12 times (Kasen joins)

These are very important for NG runs, since it allows us to recruit Kasen at any point, even before the first boss. Also very easy to farm when you don't have a full party of 12, just leave a weak character alone in the front line.

* 009 - Play for 3 hours (1000 Money)
* 010 - Play for 10 hours (5000 Money)
* 011 - Play for 30 hours (30000 Money)
* 012 - Play for 60 hours (60000 Money)
* P01 - Play for 128 hours (Uruncel Blade)
* P02 - Play for 256 hours (2000000 Money)

These go against the speedrun, since ideally we want as few of these as possible. The money is welcome, but needless to say, it's a big time loss. The plus disk ones are probably not going to be reached in a speedrun setting.

* 013 - Collect 10 Main Equips (Treasure Chest Key)
* 014 - Collect 20 Main Equips (Energy Gem)
* 015 - Collect 30 Main Equips (Wisdom Gem)
* 016 - Collect 40 Main Equips (Fighting Gem)
* P04 - Collect 54 Main Equips (Infinity Gem x2)
* P05 - Collect 60 Main Equips (Orihalcum)

These happen naturally as you collect treasures and drops. Only the first reward is good, so there's no need to go out of our way for these. The Plus Disk rewards are really good, but it will take a while to get them.

* 017 - Have 20 copies of an item (Magic Gem)
* 018 - Have 99 copies of an item (Magic Gem x2)

The first one might happen naturally with some materials, but you need to go out of your way to get the second one. The reward isn't that great though, so it's not worth the trouble.

* 019 - Have 10000 Money (Tin Watering Can)
* 020 - Have 100000 Money (Money-Growing Tree)
* 021 - Have 1000000 Money (Dark Will)
* P10 - Have 10000000 Money (Ethos of Bodybuilding 1)
* P11 - Have 100000000 Money (Adamantite)

All of the rewards are kinda junk by the time you get them, so really just let these come naturally as you collect more and more money grinding. The plus disk rewards are really good, but will take a while to achieve.

* 022 - Win 60 Battles in 1 Trip (Wash Basin Set)
* 023 - Escape 50 Battles in 1 Trip (Meteor Drive)

Both have really good rewards and can be grinded for as early as 1F, allowing for potentally OP units very early on. Escaping isn't as productive, so it may not be worth the time to escape that many battles.

* 024 - Enter Dungeon 10 times (Training Manual)
* 025 - Enter Dungeon 100 times (Training Manual x2)

These will happen naturally as you explore, there is no need to rush this unless you really need a Training Manual.

* 026 - Level Stats 255 times (Patchy Quest)
* 027 - Level Stats 2000 times (Tome of Insight - Accuracy)
* 028 - Level Stats 6000 times (Life Gem x3)
* P12 - Level Stats 20000 times (Swiftness Gem)
* P13 - Level Stats 100000 times (Wisdom Jewel)

You get these naturally as you progress, and the only one worth grinding for is the Patchy sidequest one, but even then you need to wait for 7F to recruit her, so not worth it to rush things.

* 029 - Get a Stone of Awakening (Subclasses)
* 030 - Get ALL Stone of Awakening (Subclasses for Everyone)

Vital for playing the game and specially postgame, since you don't want to be bound by the number of stones you have. More relevant for postgame categories.

* 031 - Defeat 1 FOE (DX Mechamonkey Model)
* 032 - Defeat 10 FOEs (Yuugi Fight)
* 033 - Defeat 30 FOEs (Tokyo Metronome)
* 034 - Defeat 60 FOEs (80000 Money)

The rewards are really good, but grinding FOEs is very time consuming, so this is only really grinded for categories that need Yuugi, and further need the money for the really long categories.

* 035 - Defeat 4 Unique FOEs (Fighting Gem)
* 036 - Defeat 8 Unique FOEs (Protection Gem)
* 037 - Defeat 12 Unique FOEs (Wisdom Gem)
* 038 - Defeat All FOEs back to back (Wisdom Gem)

These will happen naturally when you're grinding for achievement 34, but the rewards aren't all that great anyway so these are kinda whatever.

* 039 - Defeat 30 Unique Monsters (Tome of Insight - Resist)
* 040 - Defeat 60 Unique Monsters (5000 Money)
* 041 - Defeat 90 Unique Monsters (25000 Money)
* 042 - Defeat 120 Unique Monsters (Elixir of Mages)
* 043 - Defeat 200 Unique Monsters (Grand Master Breaker Title)
* P14 - Defeat 400 Unique Monsters (Moneybag-Growing Tree)
* P15 - Defeat 500 Unique Monsters (Dawnbreak Oil Set)
* P16 - Defeat 600 Unique Monsters (Explorer King's Legend)

These will happen naturally just by progressing the game, and the rewards are very good, too. Some rare monsters will be required if you want the 200 one, but the Plus Disk areas can help with that. The plus disk rewards are all trash.

* 044 - Gather 12 Party Members (Tome of Insight - Agility)
* 045 - Gather 24 Party Members (Items Discovery Weekly)
* 046 - Gather 36 Party Members (Money-Growing Tree)
* 047 - Gather 48 Party Members (Midnight Oil Set)
* P17 - Gather All Party Members (Spartan's Tome - Magic)

The rewards are all ass, but that's to be expected of something that just comes naturally from playing the game.

* 048 - Reach Level 10 on a Character (Life Gem x3)
* 049 - Reach Level 30 on a Character (Hero's Medal)
* 050 - Reach Level 100 on a Character (66000 Money)
* P24 - Reach Level 500 on a Character (Infinity Gem x3)
* P25 - Reach Level 1000 on a Character (Infinity Gem x5)

The amount of money makes grinding to 100 very worth it, although it's a pretty long run so that's debatable at best. Should happen naturally on the longer categories. The plus disk rewards are very underwhelming.

* 051 - Buy 3 Refined Sakes (Suika joins)

Suika is really good but it's hard to justify dropping 50k buying bad items just to recruit her.

* 052 - Collect 20 Materials (Booster v0.8)
* 053 - Collect 40 Materials (Green Dream)
* 054 - Collect 60 Materials (Portable Oscillation Cannon)
* 055 - Collect 78 Materials (Nosferatu Tome)
* P26 - Collect 96 Materials (Fighting Jewel)
* P27 - Collect 100 Materials (Affection Jewel x5)

All the rewards are kinda bad for when you get them, but these will happen naturally throughout the game so it's fine.

* 056 - Collect 25 Sub Equips (Treasure Chest Key)
* 057 - Collect 50 Sub Equips (Tome of Insight - Magic)
* 058 - Collect 75 Sub Equips (Treasure Chest Key)
* 059 - Collect 95 Sub Equips (70000 Money)
* P06 - Collect 200 Sub Equips (Energy Jewel)
* P07 - Collect 220 Sub Equips (Magic Jewel)
* P08 - Collect 230 Sub Equips (Life Jewel)
* P09 - Collect 240 Sub Equips (Veteran's Tome - HP)

The chest keys and money make these very grind worthy achievements, but it can be quite challenging to acquire them all since lots of forging and random enemy drops are necessary. The plus disk rewards are very underwhelming.

* 060 - Get 10000 EXP in 1 Trip (Growth Egg)

Very good reward for something as simple as doing some grinding on 10/11F. Should happen naturally later in the game when EXP gets inflated.

* 061 - Boost Library Levels 100 Times for a Character (Tome of Insight - Vitality)
* 062 - Boost Library Levels 750 Times for a Character (Treasure Chest Key)
* P40 - Boost Library Levels 3000 Times for a Character (Type-99 Fortified Suit)

Easy achievements to get if you're already playing around with Tomes of Reincarnation and money spending. Rewards are alright. The plus disk one is really good if you can get it early.

* 063 - Get 100 Item Drops (Items Discovery Weekly)
* 064 - Get 1000 Item Drops (Swiftness Gem)
* P41 - Get 3000 Item Drops (Treasure Chest Key x3)

These should happen naturally as you play, and the rewards are pretty bad, too. The plus disk one, however, is really useful.

* 065 - Raise a Character's MP past 50 (Star of Elendil)
* 066 - Raise a Character's TP past 50 (Energy Gem x3)

Very easy to get once you acquire an Exorcising Staff and a Tokyo Metronome, just slap those on Maintenance Nitori with some gem boosts. Rewards are okay, can be really good depending on how early you get them.

* 067 - Spend 2000 Money in Shop (Symbol of Faith)
* 068 - Spend 20000 Money in Shop (Money-Growing Tree)
* 069 - Spend 200000 Money in Shop (Treasure Chest Key)

The first reward is really important for recruiting Sanae and boosting stats early on, but it's hard to justify spending 200k on a treasure chest key. Even if you can sell everything back.

* 070 - Sell 1000 Money in Shop (Purple Metallic Armor)
* 071 - Sell 10000 Money in Shop (Treasure Chest Key)
* 072 - Sell 100000 Money in Shop (Tome of Insight - Mind)

 These all happen naturally right before finishing a run when you're selling everything. Selling 10k to get the Treasure Chest Key should be easy though if you have lots of uneeded materials.

* 073 - Walk 200 Steps (Energy Gem)
* 074 - Walk 2000 Steps (Swiftness Gem)
* 075 - Walk 5000 Steps (Tome of Insight - Evasion)
* 076 - Walk 25000 Steps (Tome of Insight - Defense)

Bad rewards for something that happens naturally as you play.

* 077 - Open 30 Treasure Chests (Tome of Reincarnation)
* 078 - Open 60 Treasure Chests (Treasure Chest Key)
* 079 - Open 100 Treasure Chests (Pride)
* 080 - Open 180 Treasure Chests (Blue Saber)
* 081 - Open 256 Treasure Chests (50000 Money)
* P42 - Open 500 Treasure Chests (Energy Jewel)

Amazing rewards to reward going out of our way when exploring. We try to get exactly 256 chests by the time we reach the High Mirror on 20F so we can minmax our way through it. The plus disk one is very underwhelming compared to how useful the others were.

* 082 - Open 3 Locked Treasure Chests (Midnight Oil Set)

Pretty bad reward for something that happens naturally.

* 083 - Craft 1 Item (200 Money)
* 084 - Craft 10 Items (2000 Money + Nitori joins)
* 085 - Craft 50 Items (Treasure Chest Key)
* 086 - Craft 100 Items (Training Manual)
* P43 - Craft 255 Items (Wisdom Jewel)

Amazing rewards, shame crafting is so oddly specific. We grind the Nitori achievement as fast as we can to use her power to smite the early game stuff. The plus disk one is kinda underwhelming.

* 087 - Get 12 Item Drops in 1 Trip (Tome of Inishgt - Attack)
* 088 - Get 36 Item Drops in 1 Trip (Master's Emblem)

These are very unreliable, but should happen naturally when doing extended grinding sessions late in the game.

* 089 - Get 100 BP on a Character (Training Manual)
* 090 - Get 1000 BP on a Character (Training Manual x2)
* 092 - Get 1000 BP on 4 Characters (Magic Gem)
* 093 - Get 3000 BP on a Character (128000 Money)
* P44 - Get 20000 BP on a Character (Fighting Jewel)

Good thing Nitori is the best trash killer for every floor, very easy to get these with her. The 3000 BP one takes a while, but is well worth it with the money it gives. The multiple characters one isn't really worth it, and neither is the plus disk one.

* 091 - Get 10000 Money in 1 Trip (Violent Green Rupee)

Not worth it to grind this early on, better to let it happen naturally when money rewards inflate.

* 094 - Beat Ame-no-Murakumo (10000 Money)
* 095 - Beat the Boss Rush (10000 Money)
* 096 - Beat the Enhanced Boss Rush (10000 Money)
* 097 - Beat 1 Deformed Boss (10000 Money)
* 098 - Beat 3 Deformed Bosses (10000 Money)
* 099 - Beat 1 Shadow Boss (10000 Money)
* 100 - Beat 12 Shadow Bosses (10000 Money)
* 101 - Beat 1 Superboss (10000 Money)
* 102 - Beat 4 Superbosses (10000 Money)
* 103 - Beat Ame-no-Murakumo v2 (10000 Money)
* 104 - Collect All Items (10000 Money)

All of these happen naturally as you're doing the postgame stuff. Really good rewards.

* P18 - Collect 1 Dark Fragment (Black Stone of Malice x5)
* P19 - Collect 20 Dark Fragments (Paracelsus' Azoth x3)
* P20 - Collect All Dark Fragments (Phosphophylite)

Rewards aren't that interesting, but these all happen naturally when playing Plus Disk so it's kinda expected.

* P21 - Collect 1 Awakening Item (Zenith Dragon's Heart)
* P22 - Collect 20 Awakening Items (Destructive Falcon Sword)
* P23 - Collect All Awakening Items (Orihalcum)

Very good rewards for something that happens naturally while playing infinity corridor anyway.

* P28 - Max Insight Skills on a Character (Life Gem x4)
* P29 - Max Spartan Skills on a Character (Protection Jewel x2)
* P30 - Max Veteran Skills on a Character (Swiftness Jewel x3)

Underwhelming rewards for something that takes quite a bunch of skill points to accomplish.

* P31 - Max Gem Count on a Character (Spartan's Tome - Sense)
* P32 - Max Jewel Count on a Character (Veteran's Tome - Attack)

Underwhelming rewards for something that takes quite a bunch of grinding to accomplish.

* P33 - Trade 20 Infinity Gems with Akyuu (250000 Money)
* P34 - Trade 100 Infinity Gems with Akyuu (Adamantite)

Very good rewards for something you will be doing anyway to get good items.

* P35 - Beat 100 Floors of Infinity Corridor (Otherworldly Rainbow Light)
* P36 - Beat 250 Floors of Infinity Corridor (Consuming Otherworldly Hole)
* P37 - Beat 640 Floors of Infinity Corridor (Consuming Otherworldly Hole x3)

Decent rewards for something that will happen anyway for the super long categories.

* P38 - Reach 30F (Life Jewel)
* P39 - Reach B11F (Consuming Otherworldly Hole)

Really bad rewards for something that will happen anyway for the super long categories.

* P45 - Beat Yamata-no-Orochi (1000000 Money)
* P46 - Beat Hollow Yamata-no-Orochi (Ame-no-Habakiri)
* P47 - Beat Dragon God (Dragon God's Scale)
* P48 - Beat WINNER (Subclass)
* P49 - Beat 1 Plus Superboss (15000000 Money)
* P50 - Beat All Plus Superbosses (15000000 Money + Iron Man's Headband)
* P51 - Beat Ame-no-Murakumo v3 (True Ame-no-Murakumo)
* P52 - Beat Full Power Dragon God (Dragon God's Power Source)

All of these happen naturally as you're doing the plus postgame stuff. Really good rewards.
