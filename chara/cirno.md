## Quick Summary

Cirno is technically optional, but she's right there on 2F and it's a 10 second detour to get her. Not only that, she's required for getting Nitori, who completely destroys the game, so in practice Cirno is required. She specializes in SPD debuffing and PAR, dealing some decent early CLD damage. Her skills are a big part of what makes these speedruns "short" in the first place.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Icicle Fall**
	* CLD composite spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to SPD-debuff(44): 88/94/100/106/112
	* Amazing tool to slow down bosses, since it's a powerful SPD debuff and has a very high proc rate. Very useful for boss fights where we need to have several turns between boss turns to damage rush.
* **Diamond Blizzard**
	* AoE CLD physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PAR(5800/6050/6300/6550/6800): 85/90/95/100/105
	* Very useful for spreading PAR on trash, or even keeping bosses PAR'd if Cirno manages to sneak in a hit. Also a strong CLD spell early on.
* **Perfect Freeze**
	* AoE CLD composite spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to SPD-debuff(32): 75/80/85/90/95
	* AoE version of Icicle Fall that has more power, but less debuff capabilities. Most useful for trash cleaning.
* **White Album**
	* Self buff DEF/MND
	* Buffs for 54/58/62/66/70
	* With how frail Cirno is, this is pretty much useless. Very situational.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **TP/SPD/AFF Boost**
	* SPD can help her quickly debuff/PAR bosses or repeatedly try to do so
* **Team 9**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Rumia/Wriggle/Mystia also in front
	* Team 9 isn't all that useful, so this goes unused
* **Always Rising after Falling**
	* Reduces TP lost after battle
	* Can be useful for grinding, but there are better skills to spend skill points on.
* **Beloved Tomboyish Girl**
	* Debuff enemy SPD by 4/8 every turn
	* Can help slowly slow down bosses, but the debuff is too small to be worth it.
* **Lively and Healthy**
	* Increases debuff and ailment recover rate
	* Not useful at all since Cirno wouldn't have those on her in the first place
* **Ability to Manipulate Ice**
	* Reduces CLD damage by 15/30%
	* Kinda situational skill since you wouldn't want Cirno hogging a front line spot.
* **Blizzard Blowout**
	* Debuffs enemy SPD by 10/20/30/40/50 when Cirno dies
	* This is extremely powerful when maxed out since it cannot be resisted. This makes Cirno a very important part for end game setups that require the boss to be slowed down.
