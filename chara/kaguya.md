## Quick Summary

Kaguya is optional, and part of the big Eientei sidequest. We do that sidequest for Wriggle and Reisen, so we can go get Kaguya, if not for the fact she's not that helpful until very late in the game when she has more skill points to abuse her skills. She can be helpful earlier as well, but we tend to prefer getting Mokou on 5F so we have access to Reisen on 7F instead of 11F. That said, Kaguya is a really good glass cannon.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/MAG/MND Boost**
	* MP Boost is essential to get her attacking more often without Concetrating
* **Residents of Eientei**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 7/14 for each of Reisen/Eirin also in front
	* All of Eientei is useful, so this skill is very good if you'll depend on all 3 of them
* **Royal People of the Moon**
	* Ignore 90% of enemy DEF/MND, but every turn there's a 75% chance to lose 1MP
	* Kaguya's best skill, it allows her to fully damage anyone in her way, without concern for how buffed the enemy is or how tanky they are
* **Robe of Fire Rat**
	* Reduces FIR damage by 15/30%
	* Very situational, but very good for FIR-based bosses
* **Desire to Rest**
	* Recover 8/16% HP and MP when switching out

* **Thousand Year Exile**
	* Boosts SPD by 66% on the back line
	* Great when paired with Desire to Rest so she's always coming to the front with enough MP to attack
