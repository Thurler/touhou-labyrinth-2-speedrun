## Quick Summary

Wriggle is optional and requires you to do a very long sidequest. She's well worth it though since her PSN can make some fights incredibly easy. And besides we want to do this side quest anyway to unlock Reisen, and we need Wriggle to unlock Yuuka, so it all works out. Outside of PSN spam she's pretty bad.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Comet on Earth**
	* NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PSN(40000): 100/103/106/109/112
	* Your most reliable PSN source for the entire game, don't expect damage though.
* **Firefly Phenomenon**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PSN(24000): 88/91/94/97/100
	* Great way to AoE PSN, with a nice duration to it, but again, don't expect damage.
* **Nightbug Tornado**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Increases damage by 25/50/75/100/125% if target is PSN
	* Can be very powerful when maxed out against a PSN enemy, but there are better damage dealers out there.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **DEF/MND/EVA Boost**
	* All of these help Wriggle's longevity while she's busy applying PSN
* **Team 9**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Rumia/Cirno/Mystia also in front
	* Team 9 isn't all that useful, so this goes unused
* **Inhale Poison**
	* Recover 12/24% HP every turn if ally is PSN'd, and reduces PSN damage
	* Very situational, Wriggle wont even be out on front for long
* **Kodoku Queen**
	* Boosts stats for every unit PSN'd
	* Can further boost Nightbug Tornado if you're using that
* **Toxic Vaccine**
	* Reduces PSN chance and duration by 20/40%
	* Very situational, since you won't get PSN'd that often in the first place
* **Insect's Commander**
	* Increases damage to Insect by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Insect-type and vulnerable to PSN
* **Poison Touch**
	* 35/70% chance to counter attacks that can PSN(10000) and PAR(4000)
	* Very situational since you'd need to build Wriggle as a tank for this to work
