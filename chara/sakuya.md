## Quick Summary

Sakuya is a mandatory character, guarding the stairs to 11F. She plays the offensive support role, helping the party go faster while dealing some damage. Unfortunately she doesn't have much in her arsenal to help, but she can be useful in some niche situations, maybe.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Misdirection**
	* AoE PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +25 ACC
	* Very low damage and also very low damage
* **Killing Doll**
	* DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +50 ACC
	* Has very high DEF influence, so can either deal lots of damage or very low damage
* **Soul Sculpture**
	* AoE WND composite spell that targets DEF
	* Cannot miss
	* Very strong and reliable thanks to good formula and perfect accuracy
* **Lunar Clock**
	* AoE SPD buff with high delay
	* Buffs for 32/35/38/41/44
	* Very useful party buff since SPD is a vital stat, specially with Extra Attack procs
* **Private Square**
	* AoE spell that deals no damage with high delay
	* Deals irresistible PAR(2000/2200/2400/2600/2800)
	* Extremely high MP cost, but vital for keeping any boss paralyzed, if the strat needs that

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/ATK/SOD Boost**
	* Her most important stats, increasing her chip damage and support capabilities
* **SDM Residents**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 5/10 for each of Meiling/Patchy/Remilia/Flandre also in front
	* Vital if using other SDM residents on the front line
* **An Eye for an Eye**
	* Buffs self ATK by 5/10 when she takes damage from an enemy
	* Can help her damage output slightly when she's focusing on that instead of support
* **Flashing Murder**
	* Increases PAR(5000) chance by 8 for all moves
	* Can be a very powerful tool with Misdirection's low delay, despite the low chance. Does not stack with Private Square
* **Piercing Attack**
	* If an attack deals 0 damage, add 20/40% of pre-defense damage to dealt damage
	* Very useful skill since Sakuya is not the best at stacking damage, this can make her deal reliable chip damage
* **Dexterity**
	* Inverts ATK/MAG debuffs on self into buffs of same magnitude
	* Very situational since you don't want your party debuffed in the first place
* **Extra Attack**
	* Adds a 16/32% chance to repeat last action at half MP cost
	* This is Sakuya's most important skill, since it can amplify her chip damage and support capabilities, at a high MP cost
* **Jack the Ludo Bile**
	* Adds a self ATK buff equal to 1/3 of self SPD buff
	* This stacks really well with Lunar Clock, since she ends up boosting two of her stats with that spell
