## Quick Summary

Meiling is completely optional and requires going on a long sidequest to free her from the tentacles keeping her in place. The events are very scattered around, and even after you do all that you still need to defeat a boss to recruit her. Meiling is one of the best tanks in the game, but it's very hard to justify getting her since it's a big time investment. She can also work as a damage dealer thanks to Mountain Breaker piercing enemy defenses, and a very durable one at that thanks to her natural bulkyness even in an ATK build.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Brilliant Light Gem**
	* SPI physical spell that targets DEF
	* Very low delay, great for delaying Meiling's turn while dealing chip damage
* **Mountain Breaker**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Amazing damage formula that ignores half of the opponent's DEF
* **Colourful Rain**
	* Self Heal that scales off ATK and MAG
	* Very powerful self heal, this helps make Meiling a self sufficient tank. Scaling off ATK also means this is great for attacking builds.
* **Healer**
	* Single target heal that scales off ATK and MAG
	* Can cure PSN, PAR and SIL
	* Very useful heal, but should be used as a quick patch instead of a fully support heal, since it's so weak. Scaling off ATK also means this is great for attacking builds playing support roles.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **TP/DEF/MND Boost**
	* TP Boost greatly helps her Guts skill proc multiple times
* **SDM Residents**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 5/10 for each of Patchy/Sakuya/Remilia/Flandre also in front
	* Vital if using other SDM residents on the front line
* **Gatekeeperâ€™s Duty**
	* Boosts front line's DEF by 4/8 every turn
	* Can help keep DEF buffs active if the party needs them, but mostly useless since dedicated buffers will take care of that
* **Guts**
	* 25/50% chance to survive a mortal blow with 1 HP, uses 10 TP
	* Amazing skill, but unreliable. Does not reset her ATB so it's really good when it does proc.
* **Natural**
	* Increases healing potency by 33/66% on herself
	* Amazing skill to boost her Colorful Rain and any other AoE heal she receives from the party
* **Gatekeeper Nap**
	* Buff SPD by 20/40% and take 16/32% less damage
	* Only procs if there are 4 characters in front and Meiling not in slot 1
	* Another amazing skill that further boosts Meiling's capabilities as a tank AND as an attacker
* **Chinese Girl's Qigong**
	* Receive a counter every turn, spend all on attack or concentrate
	* Boosts damage by 10% per counter, or heals 10% hp per counter on concentrate
	* More useful when playing a support role, since you'll spend turns switching and healing instead of attacking
