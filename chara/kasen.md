## Quick Summary

Kasen is optional, and requires 12 game overs to unlock. Since she's so immensely useful in the early game thanks to her very strong spells, we try to unlock her as soon as possible. Kasen works as a big hitter that can take a couple hits before perishing, and thus is usually a great choice for slot 2. She gets outclassed by midgame by better nukes and tanks though.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Higekiri's Cursed Arm**
	* DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +40 ACC
	* Chance to TRR(16000) and ATK/SPD-debuff(18): 100
	* Amazing power and side effects, this spell works great against bosses of any kind. This can inflict TRR for others to capitalize on, debuff important boss stats, and has a boosted ACC so it pretty much can't miss. Not to mention a lot of things are weak to DRK early on.
* **Echo of the Nine Forest Gods**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +24 ACC
	* Great spell for cleaning trash, not as helpful for bosses because of the less amazing damage formula.
* **Diving Waltz of the Raijuu**
	* WND physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PAR(5500) and MND-debuff(24): 100
	* Very high PAR chance, and also very useful to debuff bosses. Not as powerful as Cursed Arm, but the different element can make up for it.
* **Breath of the Hermit**
	* Self buff with really good delay
	* Buffs ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD for 30/32/34/36/38
	* Pretty good self buff, but ideally you want someone else buffing Kasen so she can spend her MP on her big moves

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/TP/SPD Boost**
	* TP Boost can help her Guts to proc more times.
* **Ability to Guide Animals**
	* Increases damage to Beast by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Beast-type, and not that many are, so kinda useless
* **Guts**
	* 25/50% chance to survive a mortal blow with 1 HP, uses 10 TP
	* Amazing skill, but unreliable. Does not reset her ATB so it's really good when it does proc.
* **Fighting Spirit**
	* Increases damage dealt and decreases damage dealt by 5-30%, one stack per turn, up to 6 stacks
	* Good skill for boosting Kasen if you plan on keeping her out for the fight
* **Adversity**
	* Increases damage dealt by 10/20% if afflicted with ailments or debuffs
	* Amazing skill, but unreliable since getting ailments and debuffs on oneself is kinda hard
* **Thankful Preaching**
	* Increases SIL chance by 25 and duration by 5000 for all moves
	* Since she can't stack this with anything else, it's nothing more than a nice bonus
* **Impact Attack**
	* Increases SHK chance by 25 for all moves
	* Nothing to stack on, but SHK is amazing against bosses that don't resist it, so very useful
