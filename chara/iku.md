## Quick Summary

Iku is required to beat the game, since she blocks the way to the second half of 8F. She's one of the strongest mages in the game thanks to her defense ignoring power and her high SPD stat and growth. Her spells are nothing stellar but her skills greatly enhance her powers, also helping her play a support role when needed. She's one of the best at clearing trash with the Monk sublass, thanks to 80% defense ignore and area attack.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Elekiter Dragon Palace**
	* WND magic spell that targets MND
	* Chance to PAR(5000): 72/76/80/84/88
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(50): 100
	* Amazing spell for concentrated damage, debuff and PAR infliction. Probably Iku's best spell
* **Light Dragon's Sigh**
	* AoE WND magic spell that targets MND
	* Has +40 ACC
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(36/38/40/42/44): 100
	* AoE version of Elekiter Draon Palace without the PAR effect and a bit worse debuff. Useful for trash and the rare boss fight with multiple targets.
* **Thundercloud Stickleback**
	* Single target buff with low delay
	* Buffs ATK/MAG for 52/56/60/64/68
	* Chance to PAR(6000/5500/5000/4500/4000): 120/112/104/96/88
	* Very powerful buff that might paralyze the target ally. The real odds of PAR are lower if you increase her PAR chance reduction skill.
* **Whiskers of the Dragon God**
	* Single target buff with low delay
	* Buffs SPD for 56/60/64/68/72
	* Chance to DEF/MND-debuff(44/36/28/20/12): 140/130/120/110/100
	* Sanae's best skill, allows her to buff every stat for a very large amount and quickly help key characters in boss fights.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/DEF/MAG Boost**
	* HP Boost is appreciated to guarantee Iku doesn't die midbattle when she's a key character in the fight
* **Hisouten Guard**
	* Buffs DEF/MND by 20/40% when Tenshi is also on front
	* Kinda situational since Tenshi isn't the best tank for most fights
* **Magic Counter**
	* 33/66/99% chance to counter magical attacks
	* Note this uses the regular attack command, so it can be boosted by Iku's and the Sorcerer's skills, making it very strong
* **Hagoromo Like Sky**
	* Regular attacks ignore 40/80% of target MND and deal 20/40% more damage
	* Amazing skill for Iku's main role as a defense ignoring attacker, not only for trash but also bosses
* **Flexibility**
	* Inverts DEF/MND debuffs on self into buffs of same magnitude
	* Combos really well with Whiskers of the Dragon God on herself, though you may want to keep it at Lv1
* **Supple Hagoromo**
	* Reduces PAR chance and duration by 20/40%
	* Combos really well with Thundercloud Stickleback, preventing the PAR from being too bad if it procs
* **Heavenly Maiden's Blow**
	* Double enemy defense debuffs when Iku attacks
	* Amazing skill if you can keep the enemy debuffed, since Iku will be able to penetrate a lot of MND for all her moves
* **Lightning Fish**
	* Increases base SPD by 4/8/12/16/20/24
	* SPD is the most important stat in the game
