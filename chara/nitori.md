## Quick Summary

Nitori is the absolute definition of overpowered. Maintenance alone makes Nitori a beast that can do pretty much anything, from tanking to trash cleaning to nuking bosses. Her skills further augment her powers for every situation, making her pretty much required to go fast. She is optional, however. You can avoid her by never crafting anything at all in the game, or at least no more than 9 things, since she joins on the 10th.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Kappa's Illusionary Waterfall**
	* AoE CLD physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(24): 60/64/68/72/76
	* Excellent for trash cleaning. Also for bosses since Nitori is just so strong.
* **Exteeeending Aaaaarm**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Excellent for trash cleaning. Also for bosses since Nitori is just so strong.
* **Super Scope 3D**
	* AoE Heal that scales off MAG
	* Very powerful AoE heal, Reimu's trademark spell is very useful for healing parties in a pinch, but is generally outclassed by more powerful single target heals, given everyone is min-max'd for damage or tankyness. Still has its uses.
* **Portable Versatile Machine**
	* AoE DEF/MND buff with decent delay
	* Buffs for 42/46/50/54/58
	* A vital piece for early/mid game bosses, tanks can easily handle any attacks thrown at them for a while after receiving this buff. Few battles require buffing the entire front line's defense for the entire fight though.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **DEF/MND/AFF Boost**
	* All three help her play a tank role when she's needed. Thanks to these and Maintenance, she can become your best tank for any situation.
* **Maintenance**
	* Doubles all equipment bonus
	* This is what makes Nitori so insanely strong, and defines her role as the ace in the speedrun, at least whenever raw damage or raw tanking is necessary.
* **Ability to Manipulate Water**
	* Increase CLD damage by 15/30%
	* Amazing skill to clear trash and further increase her overflowing power with Kappa's Waterfall
* **Kappa's Ecology Observation**
	* Increases damage to Aquatic by 10/20%
	* Useful skill for anything Aquatic, as Nitori has a high chance of being involved in damage dealing anyway
* **Overheating**
	* Increase MP cost by 1 and damage by 15% for each attack, caps at 5 stacks
	* This is very situational since it requires Nitori to not switch out, but it can further increase her already wild damage, so it's certainly something to plan for in long boss fights
* **Cooling Down**
	* Concentrate at full HP multiplies MP recovered by 2/3
	* This helps immensely at keeping her supplied with MP for trash and prolonged boss fights, given she's the main attacker for most of the game.
