## Quick Summary

Reimu is part of your starting party, and thus plays a very important role in the very early game. She has access to both AoE healing and DEF/MND buffing, on top of dealing very high SPI damage if the enemy's defenses are lacking. With access to very good support skills, she tends to stick with a support role towards mid and late base game.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Yin-Yang Orb**
	* SPI composite spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PAR(4000): 0/70/75/80/85
	* Very good way to deal damage early on, as some enemies are weak to SPI and may be PAR'd by it, allowing characters to take it easy when dealing with enemies. Not very useful for bosses, there are better attackers. 
* **Fantasy Seal**
	* SPI composite spell that targets MND
	* Great way to clean trash after it has been weakened, or just destroy it entirely if it's weak to SPI.
* **Exorcising Border**
	* AoE Heal that scales off MAG
	* Very powerful AoE heal, Reimu's trademark spell is very useful for healing parties in a pinch, but is generally outclassed by more powerful single target heals, given everyone is min-max'd for damage or tankyness. Still has its uses.
* **Great Hakurei Barrier**
	* AoE DEF/MND buff with decent delay
	* Buffs for 42/46/50/54/58
	* A vital piece for early/mid game bosses, tanks can easily handle any attacks thrown at them for a while after receiving this buff. Few battles require buffing the entire front line's defense for the entire fight though.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/MP/MAG Boost**
	* MP Boost helps a lot early game when MP is low for everyone and there's few Cypress Sticks
	* MAG Boost greatly helps her AoE heal
* **Main Character: Reimu**
	* Reimu herself does not need boosts to play her support role, and early on you don't want characters dying, so this is kind of useless
* **Grand Incantation**
	* Reimu does not have the power or speed to make this skill worth it
* **Hakurei's Divine Protection**
	* Can help a lot with grinding, but skill points are limited and better spent elsewhere first
* **Final Prayer**
	* Reimu's most useful skill, allows her to fully heal the front line on death, regardless of HP count. This is extremely useful when you need a large emergency heal on everyone and can manipulate the AI into killing Reimu.
* **Armored Yin-Yang Orb**
	* Another very useful skill since quite a few bosses have SPI nukes or skills, and reducing that damage by 30% is no joke. Kind of situational though, what with only resisting SPI.
* **Youkai Buster**
	* Useful skill if bosses are Youkai-type, but since Reimu usually stays in the backline this hardly ever is in effect.

## <a id="useful"></a>Role & Usefulness

#### <a id="ng-murakumo"></a>Ame-no-Murakumo (NG)

Reimu is great at killing trash in the first stratum, and helps finish things off in stratums 2 and 3. She can also help in a pinch for stratum 4, but from then on trash is cheesed with Nitori/Aya/Iku. Her great MP recovery with concentrate also helps her longevity on early grind sessions.

For bosses, Reimu is incredibly useful early on with her AoE buff and heal. Of note, early she can buff the front line's DEF to tank 3-4 hits while everyone buffs their ATK/MAG and nukes the boss. (Add info for specific bosses)
