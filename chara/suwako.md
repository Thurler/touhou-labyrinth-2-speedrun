## Quick Summary

Suwako is a mandatory character, necessary to enter 13F. She plays a purely offensive role, with varied elements and big damage numbers. While she is very useful in many scenarios, there is usually a character with better minmax capability that has an advantage over her, making her best trait the synergy with Sanae and Kanako.

	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +20 ACC
	* Chance to PAR(7200): 88/92/96/100/104
	* Decent damage and delay with very high PAR chance and duration, essential if abusing PAR

	* Has +32 ACC
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(20): 88/92/96/100/104
	* Great option to clean trash or simply debuff a boss' DEF, which further boosts its damage potential, and also the potential of her other DEF targetting spells

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/ATK/MAG Boost**
	* Her most important stats, since she plays the glass cannon role, though you probably won't need both ATK and MAG boosts together
* **Believers of Moriya**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Sanae/Kanako also in front
	* Vital if using the others, who can also be very useful
* **Earth Creation**
	* Increases damage by 16/32 if Suwako is in slot 1 and all 4 slots are filled
	* This might sound too gimmicky to work properly, but it boosts Suwako's damage enough to be worth the risk, and pairs up well with her other skills to augment her potential
* **Froggy Power!**
	* Increase NTR damage by 15/30%
	* Amazing skill to further boost Suwako's damage potential, and also helps other frontliners
* **Native God of Earth**
	* When Suwako retreats from the front with less than 66% HP, consume 1 TP to fully heal her
	* Very good skill for a glass cannon like her, since it is expected to switch her around often
* **Quickwitted**
	* Inverts SPD debuffs on self into buffs of same magnitude
	* Useless since Aya will always have her SPD buffed
