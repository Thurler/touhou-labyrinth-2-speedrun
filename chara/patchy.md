## Quick Summary

Patchouli is completely optional, and requires a long sidequest to recruit. We need to go out of our way to fight 5 extra boss fights so she can join us, and she's not even that good. She excels at dealing massive damage to bosses, but she's considerably slow and frail to be used often, requiring a lot of support just o be useful.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/MAG/AFF Boost**
	* AFF Boost is very important if you plan on keeping her out for boss fights
* **SDM Residents**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 5/10 for each of Meiling/Sakuya/Remilia/Flandre also in front
	* Vital if using other SDM residents on the front line
* **Grand Incantation**
	* Multiplies next damage/heal by 2/2.4
	* A 40% boost compared to casting a spell twice is really good, specially since it recovers MP in the process
* **Girl of Knowledge and Shade**
	* Pierces enemy affinity if over 100
	* Great for attacking enemies with lots of affinity, but you should be aiming for the weakness, not the resistance
* **Passive Philosopher's Stone**
	* Reduce damage by 35/70% from last element used in actions
	* Amazing to help her survive boss fights, but bosses are often resistant to elements they use. Can combo well with Girl of Knowledge and Shade
* **Rapid Charge**
	* Concentrate below 33% MP restores 50% extra MP at 5 TP cost
	* Very useful to replenish her MP during long fights, though Patchy doesn't have enough TP to use this often
* **The Unmoving Great Library**
	* Recover 1/2 MP every turn if on slot 4
	* Good passive to keep her MP flow going
