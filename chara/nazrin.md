## Quick Summary

Nazrin is optional, requiring us to go out of our way early on to get events that would allow her to join us on 5F. Nazrin focuses on improving battle rewards with her skills, and is geared to deal with trash. Because of this, it's hard to justify going out of our way for her, since her only role would be optimizing trash rewards and maybe recruiting Byakuren later on.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Gold Rush**
	* PHY magical spell that targets MND

	* Excellent for farming money, but Nazrin isn't too strong to make this useful
* **Rare Metal Detector**
	* WND magical spell that targets MND
	* Doubles drop item rate if it kills
	* Excellent for farming rare drops, but Nazrin isn't too strong to make this useful

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MND/SPD/EVA Boost**
	* None of these help her core usefulness in grinding stuff, except maybe SPD if she's underleveled.
* **Myouren Temple Personnel**
	* Copies Byakuren's sutra boosts every turn
	* Great synergy skill for Byakuren, but Nazrin is too weak to make good use of this
* **Bishamonten's Blessing**
	* Increases damage to Divine by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Divine-type, but Nazrin is geared more for trash fights. If anything she can just show up for a boos fight to help the nukers.
* **Dowsing**
	* Increases item drop rate by 20%
	* Great to have when farming for rare drops
* **Eyes that Perceive Reality**
	* Ignores all of enemy's buffs
	* Excellent skill against bosses and trash that buff themselves first thing in a fight
* **Extra Steps**
	* * Raise ATB to 10000 when Nazrin kills an enemy
	* Amazing skill to kill trash with, specially with Nazrin since she specializes in it to increase rewards
* **Bishamonten's Protection - Wisdom**
	* Boosts base MAG by 3/6/9/12
	* Mutually exclusive with below skill
	* This is the best skill in the long run, since Nazrin really needs as much help as she can get dealing damage
* **Bishamonten's Protection - Gale**
	* Boosts base SPD by 4/8/12/16
	* Mutually exclusive with above skill
	* MAG is more useful in the long run, but this can help close the gap on really fast trash
