## Quick Summary

Tenshi is a mandatory character, guarding the stairs to 12F. Her defenses are sky high, but she sports a lower amount of HP compared to other tank characters. She can also play the support role really well, being the best buff remover and a really good formation changer with her skills and spells. The damage output isn't the best though, you're better off using someone else for that.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **World Creation Press**
	* NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to ATK-debuff(12/13/14/15/16): 92/96/100/104/108
	* Very good damage formula, with a nice debuff to pair with it, but with Tenshi hardly ever playing an offensive role, this ends up being very situational.
* **Violent Motherland**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to MAG/SPD-debuff(12/13/14/15/16): 92/96/100/104/108
	* Not as strong as World Creation Press, but its debuffs can be more useful. Once again though, it's very situational since there are better debuffers and damage dealiers.
* **Sword of Hisou**
	* SPI physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has perfect accuracy
	* Chance to remove enemy buffs: 24/28/32/36/40
	* Tenshi's best spell, it's both capable of dealing good damage and providing support by removing enemy buffs, not to mention the perfect accuracy.
* **State of Enlightenment**
	* Self DEF/MND buff with good delay
	* Buffs for 100/110/120/130/140
	* Chance to HVY(16000) and PAR(8000): 128/120/112/104/96
	* Can make her immortal depending on the fight, but paralyzing her and locking her in for the fight might give you one less slot to work with.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **TP/AFF/RES Boost**
	* Complements her defenses really well, reducing overall damage and making her more immune to her own self buff's side effects
* **Girl of Bhava-agra**
	* Increases ATK/MAG by 20/40 if Iku is in the front line
	* Stellar skill if using Tenshi offensively, which is very situational
* **Always Rising after Falling**
	* Reduces TP lost after battle
	* Can be useful for grinding, but there are better skills to spend skill points on.
* **Keystone Formation**
	* If Tenshi is in slot 1 and does a Form Change, buffs frontline's stats by 7%
	* Incredibly useful when using Tenshi defensively as a switcher, gives her important utility
* **Sword of Hisou's Owner**
	* 20/40% chance to remove enemy's buffs when attacking
	* Stacks with Sword of Hisou to make it even more likely to remove buffs
* **Murakumo's Former Owner**
	* Recovers frontline's HP by 5% if Tenshi takes a turn with an ailment
	* Stacks nicely with State of Enlightenment's HVY, but still very situational
* **Free from Worldly Thoughts**
	* Reduces PHY damage by 15/30%
	* Very nice support skill since Tenshi is supposed to stay in front
* **Enduring Celestial**
	* Starts every battle with a 33% DEF/MND buff
	* Activates even if she's in the back, can reduce the need to State of Enlightenment for every battle
