## Quick Summary

Utsuho is mandatory to beat the game, and she works as a magic glass cannon for cleaning trash. Her kit can be useful for bosses, but there are better nukes out there. She has some gimmicks going for her with her spells, but nothing too extraordinary to make her indispensable.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Giga Flare**
	* AoE MYS magical spell that almost ignores MND
	* Very high delay and power, great for enemies with incredibly high defensive stats
* **Intense Nuclear Reaction**
	* AoE FIR magical spell that targets MND
	* Buffs self MAG for 20/21/22/23/24
	* Debuffs self DEF/MND by 12/11/10/9/8 and SPD by 8/7/6/5/4
	* Good attack that gets stronger the more you use it, but the SPD debuff kind of ruins it. The defense ones are kind of whatever since Utsuho is frail in the first place.
* **Hell's Tokamak**
	* AoE FIR magical spell that targets MND
	* Chance to MND-debuff(20/22/24/26/28): 112/114/116/118/120
	* Great tool for debuffing the opponent's MND, but if you need the debuff this attack won't deal much damage, and there are better MND debuffers

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/MP/MAG Boost**
	* MP Boost is essential to use her early on when Giga Flare is very costly
* **Earth Spirits Palace Party**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Rin/Satori/Koishi also in front
	* Vital if using the others, but they don't synergize too well until very late in the game
* **Blazing**
	* Increase FIR damage by 15/30%
	* Very useful skill for boosting not only Utsuho's damage but also anyone else with access to FIR nukes
* **Overheating**
	* Increase MP cost by 1 and damage by 15% for each attack, caps at 5 stacks
	* This is very situational since it requires Utsuho to not switch out, but it can increase her damage by a lot if she manages to survive
* **Fighting Spirit**
	* Increases damage dealt and decreases damage dealt by 5-30%, one stack per turn, up to 6 stacks
	* Again very situational since keeping Utsuho on front may not be the best idea
* **Sheer Force**
	* Lower enemy AFF if it's over 100 and enemy RES by 33%
	* Can be very useful to increase Giga Flare damage on resistant foes and inflict statuses with Toxicologist. Also pretty much guarantees a MND debuff on Hell's Tokamak
