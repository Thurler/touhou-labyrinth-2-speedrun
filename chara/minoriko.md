## Quick Summary

Minoriko is mandatory to beat the game as the 5F rock requires her to be recruited. Minoriko has access to strong NTR damage early on and a potent heal and defense buff with decent delay, making her an excellent character for the supportive role in boss fights. She can also be used to clean trash with her NTR skills, but quickly gets outclassed by others in that department.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Autumn Sky**
	* NTR magic spell that targets MND
	* Actually composite with her MAG and MND
	* Powerful and cheap, this is her NTR finisher for trash and can help in some early fights where NTR damage options are limited.
* **Warm Colour Harvest**
	* AoE NTR magic spell that targets MND
	* Actually composite with her MAG and MND
	* Great way to clean trash after it has been weakened, or just destroy it entirely if it's weak to NTR. Kinda costly though.
* **Sweet Potato Room**
	* Single target Heal that scales off MAG and MND
	* Very powerful heal, most useful in early boss fights when she has the only useful single target heal. Also helpful later on when lower delay is prefered over healing potency.
* **Owotoshi Harvester**
	* DEF/MND buff with very short delay
	* Buffs for 45/48/51/54/57
	* A spammable single target version of Reimu's Great Hakurei Barrier. Excellent for midfight buffing since the delay is so short and only buffs those that really need it.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MAG/SPD/RES Boost**
	* MAG and SPD Boost are very important when healing
* **Symbol of Harvest**
	* Increases damage to Plant by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Plant-type and Minoriko is staying for the fight
* **Desire to Rest**
	* Recover 8/16% HP and MP when switching out
	* Can be useful to restore some MP in a pinch, but there are better skills for that
* **Regeneration**
	* Restores 10% HP every turn
	* Minoriko shouldn't be taking many hits in the first place, we have better MND tanks
* **Ability to Control Harvests**
	* Boosts front line's MAG by 4/8 every turn
	* Can help keep MAG buffs active if the party needs them, kind of situational for some bosses
* **Emergency Recovery**
	* Concentrate below 66% HP restores 66% HP at 3 TP cost
	* Great for healing in a pinch, but Minoriko shouldn't be taking hits in the first place
* **Rapid Charge**
	* Concentrate below 33% MP restores 50% extra MP at 5 TP cost
	* Very useful to fully replenish her MP after many buffs and heals early on, her most important skill
