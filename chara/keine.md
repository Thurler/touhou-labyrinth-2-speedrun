## Quick Summary

Keine is part of your starting party, and thus plays a very important role in the very early game. Her AoE damage spells quickly become useless and enemy defenses grow and Keine's MAG doesn't, so she ends up playing a mostly supportive role with her buffs and skills.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Ancient History -Old History-**
	* DRK magic spell that targets DEF
	* Kinda useful for very early trash, but quickly fades into a bad spell dealing 0 to everyone
* **New History -Next History-**
	* SPI magic spell that targets MND
	* Kinda useful for very early trash, but quickly fades into a bad spell dealing 0 to everyone
* **Three Treasures - Sword**
	* AoE ATK/MAG buff with good delay
	* Buffs for 24/27/30/33/36
	* Very important buff to have since damage rushing is a common strat in the speedrun, and buffing more than one character's attack power at the same time is incredibly helpful.
* **Three Treasures - Mirror**
	* AoE DEF/MND buff with good delay
	* Buffs for 24/27/30/33/36
	* Not as useful as Sword since it's outclassed by other defensive buffs, particularly Reimu's.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/TP/MAG Boost**
	* MP Boost helps a lot early game when MP is low for everyone and there's few Cypress Sticks
* **With Mokou**
	* Buffs self ATK/MAG for 21/42 if Mokou is in front
	* Useless since we never use Keine offensively after getting Mokou
* **Organized Formation**
	* Restores 1 MP for all 3 characters involved in Form Changes
	* Decent skill but Keine focuses on buffing, not switching
* **Firm Defense**
	* Buffs self DEF/MND by 5/10 when she takes a hit
	* The buff is way too small to make this worth it since Keine doesn't tank many hits before dying
* **Teacher's Command**
	* Buff frontline MND by 6/12 when she gets a turn
	* Useful for keeping the party buffed, but very situational
* **Historian's School**
	* Increases EXP for 6% for entire party
	* Great skill for grinding specific characters
* **History Accumulation**
	* Buffs self ATK/MAG and DEF/MND with each use Sword/Mirror, up to 10/20/30 and 12/24/36
	* Too expensive to be useful early on, but could make Keine more useful for some fights
