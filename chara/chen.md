## Quick Summary

Chen is completely optional, and takes quite some effort to recuit, since you must go out of your way on 3 floors to trigger an event with her, and then defeat an FOE to get her. She is well worth the effort though, since she can deal lots of damage by herself with her skills, and further support from the team just augments her qualities. She's also great for switching pivoting thanks to Instant Attack, making her a very useful character in almost every situation.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Flight of Idaten**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* With very little delay and a decent formula, spamming this on trash and bosses is a good way to deal damage to PHY-weak stuff.
* **Phoenix Spread Wings**
	* Row FIR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chen's best spell for clearing trash and damaging bosses weak to FIR. Powered up by the Warrior subclass and Blazing can make this quite devastating.
* **Kimontonkou**
	* Self ATK buff that debuffs DEF/MND
	* Buffs for 80/90/100/110/120, Debuffs for 100/90/80/70/60
	* Chen's most important tool to damage stuff at higher levels, since her ATK doesn't scale that well against enemies' DEF. Using this can also free your buffer to buff someone else, since Chen shouldn't take hits anyway.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **ATK/SPD/EVA Boost**
	* All three help make Chen an amazing tool against trash and bosses
	* EVA Boost can help her become a blink tank for some fights
* **Yakumo Clan**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Ran/Yukari also in front
	* Vital if using Ran and Yukari in late game, useless otherwise
* **Instant Attack**
	* Sets ATB to 10000 when Momiji swaps in
	* Excellent skill for pivoting character switches. E.g. A uses a high delay move, B swaps A with Momiji, who swaps self for A, that now gets 7500 ATB. Very useful for damage rushes.
* **Beat Down**
	* When Chen kills something, restore 1/2 MP and buff ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16
	* This is what makes Chen excel at dealing with trash, since she can easily restore her used MP without wasting a turn on Concentrate.
* **Accelerate**
	* Buffs self SPD by 10% every turn
	* Can be very good for speeding Chen up on Flight of Idaten spam, but not as useful as you'd think since she's already really fast.
* **Idaten**
	* Reduces HVY chance and duration by 40%
	* Very situational, HVY isn't that bad of an ailment to be worth keeping Chen on front for all fight
* **Screw this, I'm outta here**
	* Rudeces TP penalty for fleeing a battle
	* Can be kinda useful by the end of a run when no further EXP is needed so all trash is ignored
