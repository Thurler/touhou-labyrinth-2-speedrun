Kanako is a mandatory character, necessary to enter 13F. She plays a purely offensive role, with varied elements and big damage numbers. While she is very useful in many scenarios, there is usually a character with better minmax capability that has an advantage over her, making her best trait the synergy with Sanae and Suwako.
