## Quick Summary

Mystia is optional, and requires defeating the 4F FOE to recruit. Since she isn't all that strong or useful, it's kind of hard too justify going out of our way to kill a boss just to get her. She specializes in inflicting ailments.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Ill-Starred Dive**
	* WND physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +20 ACC
	* Cheap and with good delay, great for dealing with trash or chipping bosses
* **Poisonous Moth's Dark Dance**
	* AoE NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to PSN(15000) and PAR(5000): 64/68/72/76/80/84/88
	* Very strong spell that can also PSN and PAR, unlike Wriggle's weak PSN only AoE spell. Great for crippling trash and even bosses
* **Midnight Chorus Master**
	* AoE WND physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +30 ACC, chance to SIL(32000): 90/95/100/105/110/115/120
	* Amaing AoE spell for inflicting SIL and dealing big damage, and is more reliable than Parsee's SIL. Mystia's best spell.
* **Mysterious Song**
	* AoE heal that cures SIL and sometimes PAR and HVY
	* Also heals whenever something is cured
	* Chance for added ailment cure: 64/68/72/76/80%
	* Very situational heal that only works reliably for when you're SIL. Not very useful.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/ATK/SPD Boost**
	* MP Boost helps a lot early game when MP is low for nuking bosses over and over
* **Team 9**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Rumia/Cirno/Wriggle also in front
	* Team 9 isn't all that useful, so this goes unused
* **Diva of Darkness**
	* Reduces SIL chance and duration by 20/40%
	* Very situational, SIL is a really bad ailment to have, but keeping Mystia on front is worse usually
* **Silent Singing Voice**
	* Boosts stats for every unit SIL'd
	* Can further boost her power after a Midnight Chorus Master, pretty good skill
* **Soothing Type**
	* Heal 1 MP for front liners when Mystia Concentrates
	* Very situational, Mystia would heal her MP on the back lines
* **Instant Attack**
	* Sets ATB to 10000 when Mystia swaps in
	* Excellent skill for pivoting character switches. E.g. A uses a high delay move, B swaps A with Mystia, who swaps self for A, that now gets 7500 ATB. Very useful for damage rushes.
