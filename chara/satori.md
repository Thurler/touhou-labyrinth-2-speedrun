## Quick Summary

Satori is required to beat the game, and is a very gimmicky character. She has only a single spell of her own, and her other means of attack and support are borrowing spells from her teammates, meaning she can play any support or offensive role desired, so long as she has the stats to back it up. Her excellent HP growth makes her an amazing supporting tank, but she can also do well attacking with her average ATK and good MAG.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Brain Fingerprint**
	* AoE MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Chance to SIL(20000): 40/44/48/52/56
	* Has perfect accuracy
	* Not the best spell out there, but it can get some chip damage going and apply SIL to all enemies

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/ATK/MAG Boost**
	* MP Boost is vital to make Satori efficient, since borrowed spells will have additional cost early on
* **Earth Spirits Palace Party**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Rin/Utsuho/Koishi also in front
	* Vital if using the others, but they don't synergize too well until very late in the game
* **Eyes that Perceive Reality**
	* Ignores all of enemy's buffs
	* Great for dealing with buffed bosses that would overwhelm Satori with inflated stats
* **Small MP Recovery**
	* Restore 25% MP when switching out
	* Vital skill to keep Spell Recollection going, specially with Instant Attack pivoting
* **Trauma Recollection**
	* Increase damage by 12/24% if hitting enemy weakness
	* Very important skill for Satori to have if she'll stay in the front line, since ideally you'll always be hitting a boss' weakness.
* **Spell Card Recollection**
	* Allows access to front line's spells at Lv0, costing 5/4/3/2/1 extra MP to cast
	* The definition of Satori's gimmick, very important to max this as fast as possible so the extra MP cost isn't too prohibitive
