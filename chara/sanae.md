## Quick Summary

Sanae is required to beat the game, since we need her to recruit Kanako and Suwako, who are required. Sanae is an amazing healer and buffer, featuring the most complete heal and most efficient buff in the game, with amazing skills to help her play the support role. She can also work offensively to take care of trash, but there are better damage dealers.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **DEF/MAG/MND Boost**
	* MAG Boost improves her healing potency as well, so it's probably the most useful
* **Believers of Moriya**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Kanako/Suwako also in front
	* Vital if using the others, who can also be very useful
* **Expansion of Conciousness**
	* Increases MP recovery by 1/2
	* Great for bosses that consume a lot of MP or just zero out the entire party
* **Last Wish**
	* Buffs ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD of all front line for 33/66 when Sanae is KO'd
	* Amazing skill if you can plan Sanae's death, which can be kind of hard depending on the boss
* **Moriya's Divine Protection**
	* 14/28% Chance to restore 1 TP after battle
	* Can help a lot with grinding, but skill points are limited and better spent elsewhere first
* **Power of the Living God**
	* Increase SPI damage by 15/30%
	* Very useful for bosses that are weak to SPI, since Sanae will likely be out for bosses anyway
* **Youkai Buster**
	* Increases damage to Youkai by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Youkai-type, specially since Sanae will likely be out for bosses anyway
