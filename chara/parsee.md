## Quick Summary

Parsee is optional, but she's so immensely useful that she's worth the short 1F detour after 12 characters are recruited. Not only is she amazing at tanking with her absurdly high MND, she's a great attacker that focuses on applying and capitalizing on TRR. An oversight in one of her skills makes her absolutely necessary for some boss fights, since it allows us to one-shot them after some turns, making her as valuable to the speedrun as broken Nitori.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Large Box and Small Box**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Randomly deals 3x damage, chance increases with spell level
	* Very situational thanks to the random chance of dealing more damage.
* **Midnight Anathema Ritual**
	* DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to TRR(50000): 66/69/72/75/78
	* Chance to SIL(40000): 66/69/72/75/78
	* Excellent for inflicting TRR and SIL, and with a huge duration too. This is particularly important for TRR since it synergizes well with Jealously of the Kind and Lovely.
* **Grudge Returning**
	* AoE DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to TRR(14000): 100/105/110/120/125
	* More reliable at inflicting TRR, but at a shorter duration and AoE. Very useful for trash or just inflicting TRR for some quick capitalization with Jealously of the Kind and Lovely.
* **Jealousy of the Kind and Lovely**
	* AoE DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Deals 0 damage if enemy is not TRR'd, removes TRR
	* Increases damage by about 5% per 10000 TRR
	* This added effect seems like a nice harmless boost at first, making this a great nuke but there is a spell that increases ailment duration on enemies, which makes it possible to scale TRR to absurdly high levels like 10 million and over, giving this spell a 5000% boost in damage for that scenario. This can then be used to one shot bosses while they're stuck in their mostly harmless phase 1.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/MND/RES Boost**
	* MP Boost is vital for increasing her potential power in firing her TRR spells multiple times.
* **Two-Way Curse**
	* Increases damage done and reduces damage taken by 12/24% if Parsee has an ailment
	* Not very reliable since it's hard to inflict ailments on yourself, but this can further boost Jealously of the Kind so can be pretty good.
* **Final Blow**
	* Increases damage by 16/32% if enemy has ailment
	* This skill is amazing when paired with Jealously of the Kind's special effect, and is vital to make the strat work faster.
* **Jealousy Manipulation**
	* Increases damage the more allies and enemies are affected by debuffs
	* Very useful since you'll be debuffing enemies a lot, but kinda unreliable since it's hard to debuff yourself consistently in big fights.
* **Flames of Jealousy**
	* Increase DRK damage by 15/30%
	* This further boosts Jealously of the Kind so it's a very important skill.
* **Emergency Recovery**
	* Concentrate below 66% HP restores 66% HP at 3 TP cost
	* Great for healing in a pinch, specially useful for fights where Parsee needs to be the MND tank
