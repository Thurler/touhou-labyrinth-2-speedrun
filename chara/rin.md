## Quick Summary

Rin is mandatory to beat the game, and she works as a speedster character that can inflict some ailments and debuffs. She can also work as a damage dealer, but she's far from the best at that role, making her usage very situational for some booss fights. Thanks to her high SPD, Rin is best when playing the support role, particularly when swapping characters thanks to her skillset.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Cat's Walk**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to SHK: 40/44/48/52/56/60/64
	* Its low delay makes this an amazing tool for stunning bosses that do not resist SHK, or just deal chip damage while Rin is waiting for a character switch opportunity
* **Vengeful Cannibal Spirit**
	* DRK composite spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to TRR(10000): 40/44/48/52/56/60/64
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(25): 50/54/58/62/66/70/74
	* Decent attack with a good chance to debilitate the enemy. Can deal quite a bit of damage if building Rin offensively
* **Former Hell's Needle Hill**
	* Row PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Chance to DEF-debuff(25): 60/64/68/72/76/80/84
	* Rin's strongest spell since it can be boosted by Warrior's row enhance skill, and also has higher chance of debuffing the enemy.
* **Blazing Wheel**
	* AoE FIR composite spell that targets MND
	* Rin's trash cleaner, but since it's composite you might be better off going with Needle Hill for higher damage and better delay

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **ATK/MAG/SPD Boost**
	* SPD Boost is essential to make her excel as a switcher support role
* **Earth Spirits Palace Party**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16 for each of Utsuho/Satori/Koishi also in front
	* Vital if using the others, but they don't synergize too well until very late in the game
* **Hell's Necromancer**
	* Reduces TRR chance and duration by 20/40%
	* Very situational, TRR isn't that bad of an ailment and there are better ways to spend Rin's skill points
* **Speedy Formation Change**
	* Sets Rin's ATB to 8000/9000 after she does a Form Change
	* This is what makes Rin excel as a switcher, she can very quickly change the party composition at will with enough SPD
* **Two-Way Curse**
	* Increases damage done and reduces damage taken by 12/24% if Parsee has an ailment
	* Not very reliable since it's hard to inflict ailments on yourself
* **Final Blow**
	* Increases damage by 16/32% if enemy has ailment
	* This skill is amazing if you're planning to use Vengeful Cannibal Spirit, since TRR sticks and Extra Attack can proc the spell multiple times for more TRR chances and boosted damage if it does proc.
* **Extra Attack**
	* Adds a 16/32% chance to repeat last action at half MP cost
	* This can make Rin very powerful and very versatile, going for ailments multiple times or just dealing damage repeatedly. Not very reliable though, with the low odds of proc'ing, but it can proc on itself, making it a very important skill for offensive Rin.
* **Apparition Carrier**
	* When Rin kills an enemy, recover 33% HP, 1 MP, and buff ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 20
	* Useful when killing lots of trash
