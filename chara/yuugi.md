## Quick Summary

Yuugi is completely optional and requires us to defeat 10 FOEs to unlock her battle. Since defeating the same FOEs over and over can cost a lot of time, she is avoided in categories that do not require all characters, since going out of our way to get her takes a while. Yuugi excels at nuking bosses with her super strong spells, while being capable of taking hits with her high HP nd DEF. A really good character locked behind a very long unlock criteria.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Supernatural Phenomenon**
	* NTR physical spell that targets DEF
	* Good delay and high power, this spell is very spammable and is a great tool against bosses weak to NTR
* **Knockout in Three Steps**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has -25 ACC
	* Pierces a lot of DEF, has low ACC, max delay, this spell requires an all or nothing approach, but is great for nuking bosses with Instant Attack pivoting
* **Irremovable Shackles**
	* SPI physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has +25 ACC
	* Chance to PAR(3000): 86/90/94/98/102
	* Chance to HVY(10000) or SIL(10000): 66/70/74/78/82
	* Not as powerful as her other spells, but can inflict several ailments to help increase the team's damage output. Really good spell for some boss fights.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/ATK/DEF Boost**
	* ATK Boost makes her incredibly powerful early in the game, but MP will be a concern
* **Physical Counter**
	* 33/66/99% chance to counter physical attacks
	* Note this uses the regular attack command, so it can be boosted by the Warrior's skills, making it very strong
* **Last Fortress**
	* Increase stats by 4% for every character that dies in battle
	* Amazing skill for boss fights where characters must be sacrificed or just die as the boss nukes everyone
* **Beat Down**
	* When Yuugi kills something, restore 1/2 MP and buff ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16
	* Good for cleaning up trash and recovering MP while doing so
* **Ruinous Super Strength**
	* Increase PHY damage by 15/30%
	* Very useful skill for boosting not only Yuugi's damage but also anyone else with access to PHY nukes like Nitori and Yukari
* **Hoshiguma Dish**
	* Buffs ATK/SPD by up to 12% depending on how many enemies there are: fewer = ATK, more = SPD
	* Good skill for bosses, since this will maintain Yuugi's buffs high on her turns
* **Adamant Helix**
	* Increases damage the less HP Yuugi has compared to max HP, up to 66% damage boost
	* Kinda situational since having Yuugi low on HP is a risk and not exactly easy to do reliably
