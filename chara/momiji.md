## Quick Summary

Momiji is guarding the way to the western part of 1F, making her practically a starting character and a very important one at that. She's not the best tank, but her high HP and DEF are very helpful early on to tank most strong hits while you don't recruit a better tank.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Rabies Bite**
	* PHY physical spell that targets DEF
	* Good to finish weakened trash or just deal chip damage to bosses while waiting for switch opportunities
* **Expellee's Canaan**
	* AoE WND physical spell that targets DEF
	* Great at cleaning super early trash that doesn't resist WND, but grows weaker with time as Momiji's ATK doesn't scale well with the opponents' DEF.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/ATK/DEF Boost**
	* All three really help make Momiji more useful, but skill points are limited and there's better things to spend them on.
* **Ability to See Far Distances**
	* Increase front line's ACC by 25/50%
	* Great skill against highly evasive enemies, or when you really can't afford to get a miss
* **Tengu's Watchful Eye**
	* Increases damage to Flying by 10/20%
	* Useful skill if bosses are Flying-type and Momiji plays some role in the fight
* **Accelerate**
	* Buffs self SPD by 10% every turn
	* Great skill early on when Momiji plays the tank and switcher role
* **Eyes that Perceive Reality**
	* Ignores all of enemy's buffs
	* Excellent skill against bosses that buff themselves really high. Ends up not being as useful against bosses that mainly target MND.
* **Instant Attack**
	* Sets ATB to 10000 when Momiji swaps in
	* Excellent skill for pivoting character switches. E.g. A uses a high delay move, B swaps A with Momiji, who swaps self for A, that now gets 7500 ATB. Very useful for damage rushes.
