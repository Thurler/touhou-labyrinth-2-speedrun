	* Very weak in damage and PSN, not at all useful
* **Grand Patriot's Elixir**
	* Self buff with incredibly little delay, but very costly
	* Buffs ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 32/34/36/38/40
	* Reisen's very spammable self buff that makes her very strong for some fights, but even with these she's far outclassed when it comes to dealing damage to others. The SPD boost is very nice though.

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/MAG/SPD Boost**
	* SPD Boost is essential to make her have many opportunities to try and inflict ailments on the bosses
* **Residents of Eientei**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 7/14 for each of Kaguya/Eirin also in front
	* All of Eientei is useful, so this skill is very good if you'll depend on all 3 of them
* **People of the Moon**
	* Ignore 50% of enemy DEF/MND, but every turn there's a 75% chance to lose 1MP
	* Reisen can use this to help her damage output against very tanky bosses, but 50% isn't that meaningful of a cut
* **Final Blow**
	* Increases damage by 16/32% if enemy has ailment
	* This skill is great for capitalizing on Reisen's high chances of inflicting ailments, but her damage output still won't be superb
* **Broad Mind Modulation**
	* Debuff enemy MND by 6/12 every turn
	* Very useful for keeping enemies debuffed, the problem is keeping Reisen out for this to proc constantly. Combos well with Grand Patriot's Elixir.
* **Wavelength of Insanity**
	* Reduces MYS damage by 15/30%
	* Very useful for reducing damage from a very common element, but Reisen isn't that tanky to make this as useful as it sounds
* **Intense Vertigo**
	* Decrease enemy affinity and resistance by 20%
	* By far Reisen's most important skill, since it not only helps her but all of her teammates. This also reduces DTH resistance, making it vital to cheese some boss fights.
