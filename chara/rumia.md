## Quick Summary

Rumia is an optional character that focuses on dealing piercing damage and playing the support role. Recruiting her is a very low investment, a mere 480 money early on, and she's a very useful ally thanks to her encounter rate reducing skill, which saves an enormous amount of time by itself.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Moonlight Ray**
	* MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Very powerful spell that has a really good damage formula, should be used on things with low MND
* **Dark Side of the Moon**
	* AoE DRK magic spell that ignores defenses
	* Since this completely bypasses defenses, this is a great tool to kill enemies with absurdly high DEF/MND but low HP
* **Demarcation**
	* AoE Heal that scales off MAG and reduces debuffs on party
	* Not very powerful as a heal, and removing debuffs is very situational, so this isn't all that useful

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MAG/SPD/AFF Boost**
	* MAG and SPD Boosts help her clean off some trash early on
* **Team 9**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8 for each of Cirno/Wriggle/Mystia also in front
	* Team 9 isn't all that useful, so this goes unused
* **Realm of Eternal Darkness**
	* Reduces DRK damage by 15/30%
	* Can be very helpful for bosses that rely on DRK to attack, but having Rumia on the front can do more harm than good
* **Youkaiâ€™s Knowledge**
	* Increases damage to Human by 10/20%
	* Useful skill as many bosses are Human-type, but having Rumia on the front can do more harm than good
* **Piercing Attack**
	* If an attack deals 0 damage, add 20/40% of pre-defense damage to dealt damage
	* Very useful skill for some trash with very high MND, since Moonlight Ray would deal 0 damage and instead does some good MYS damage
* **Darkness Manipulation**
	* Reduces encounter rate by 12/24%
	* Rumia's most important skill since it allows for quicker navigation of the dungeon
