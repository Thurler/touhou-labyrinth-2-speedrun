## Quick Summary

Marisa is part of your starting party, and thus plays a very important role in the very early game. She's pretty much a MYS glass cannon, so Marisa shines against trash and enemies that do not resist that element, allowing her to deal big damage with both single tartget and AoE spells.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Magic Missile**
	* MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Great basic single target spell with low cost and average delay, should be used as her basic attack.
* **Asteroid Belt**
	* AoE MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* AoE version of Magic Missile that doesn't penetrate enemy MND as much. Very powerful trash cleaner early on, since things aren't very defensive.
* **Master Spark**
	* AoE MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Spends extra MP to increase damage, leaves Marisa with 0
	* Marisa's AoE nuke that absolutely destroys everything not resistant to MYS. Excellent at finishing off bosses before they can act on their berserk stages, but can only really be used once so careful planning should go into using this.
* **Concentration**
	* Self MAG buff
	* Buffs for 24/27/30/33/36
	* Very low delay, so very helpful early on when buffing options are greatly limited

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/MAG/SPD Boost**
	* MP Boost is very important early on for getting access to Master Spark, and then maintaining it without MP equipment
* **MAlice Cannon (Marisa)**
	* Buffs SPD by 15/30% when Alice is on backline
	* Very situational considering Marisa doesn't usually stay out front and Alice is optional.
* **Main character - Marisa**
	* Recovers 1/2 MP and buffs self by 10/20 every turn if 5 characters KO'd
	* Too situational to be useful, specially since Marisa doesn't stay in front that often
* **Sheer Force**
	* Lower enemy AFF if it's over 100 and enemy RES by 33%
	* Can be very useful to increase Master Spark damage on resistant foes and inflict statuses with Toxicologist
* **Sudden Impulse**
	* Increases damage variance, but increases damage on average
	* Not exactly useful since we look for consistency in a game like this
* **Lively and Healthy**
	* Increases debuff and ailment recover rate
	* Not useful at all since Marisa wouldn't have those on her in the first place
* **Magic Training**
	* Increase MYS damage by 15/30%
	* Very useful skill for boosting not only Marisa's damage but also anyone else with access to MYS nukes
