## Quick Summary

Ran is completely optional, requiring Chen to activate several events on floors 4 through 9, so you can beat her as a boss and recruit her. It's a very long sidequest that can be justified since Ran is an amazing support character, and can sweep through trash as well, but there are other ways to accomplish what she tries to do without recruiting her. Her synergy with Chen and Yukari is irreplaceable, however.
