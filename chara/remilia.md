## Quick Summary

Remilia is a mandatory character, guarding the stairs to 11F. She's fairly tanky and can deal a lot of damage, but is severely limited in attacking options without subclasses. Her skills further augment her tanking and damage capabilities, making her a very reliable character to use overall.

* **Adversity**
	* Increases damage dealt by 10/20% if afflicted with ailments or debuffs

	* Very helpful for boss fights that deplete your MP, specially since Spear the Gungir has low cost
