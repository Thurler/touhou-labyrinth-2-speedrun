## Quick Summary

Hina is a mandatory character, and her gimmick is debuffing herself and her allies so she can power up and deal lots of damage to enemies. Since her gimmick often requires a very specific setup to work properly, specially early on in the game, she isn't that reliable. There are also better damage dealers that are simpler to setup and hitway harder. Hina can opt to work as a MND tank, but it's not the most optimal build for her.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Misfortune God's Biorhythm**
	* AoE debuff spell that hits all allies and enemies
	* Chance to ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD-debuff(33): 90/93/96/99/102
	* This is a very potent self buff, and thanks to her skills she can greatly reduce the party side effects. Most important spell for her debuff gimmick.
* **Pain Flow**
	* AoE DRK magical spell that targets MND
	* Removes every debuff from Hina, multiplies damage by debbuff magnitude * 1.5
	* Since this removes her debuffs, this will leave her wihtout her amazing buffs, so its use is very situational. Works as a big nuke pretty much
* **Old Lady Ohgane's Fire**
	* Row FIR magical spell that targets MND
	* Chance to ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD-debuff(25): 80/85/90/95/100
	* Hina's conventional spell that deals good damage while debuffing the foe

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/DEF/MND Boost**
	* All three help her become extra bulky to play her tank / tanky bruiser role.
* **Warding Away Bad Luck**
	* Reduces debuff chance and duration by 20/40%
	* Very imporant to reduce the side effects of Misfortune God's Biorhythm on your party
* **Two-Way Curse**
	* Increases damage done and reduces damage taken by 12/24% if Parsee has an ailment
	* Very situational since debuffs don't count as ailments
* **Curse Reversal**
	* Debuffs on Hina are calculated as if they were buffs with twice the magnitude
	* The crux of her gimmick, this allows her to very easily buff herself for 66% in all stats in a single turn
* **Misfortune Stockpilling**
	* Transfer 33/66% of party's debuffs to Hina when she uses Concentrate
	* Very situational since it would require your party to be fully debuffed to be worth the long concentrate delay
* **Spinning More than Usual**
	* Buff ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 33 and heal 10 MP if Hina has TRR/HVY/SIL on her turn
	* This plays against her gimmick, so this is better left unused
* **Role of Nagashi-bina**
	* Debuff own ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 6/12 every turn
	* Great skill to keep her debuffs going after applying a big one with Biorhythm
