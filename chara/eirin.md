## Quick Summary

Eirin is optional, but if you're doing the Eientei sidequest anyway she can join you in either 7F or 11F depending on who you picked in 5F. Eirin is an amazing healer and ailment spreader, and can also deal some damage to boot. Much like Kaguya, she's nice, strong and helpful, but is outclassed by others in all of her roles, save for her one niche skill.

## <a id="spells"></a>Spells List

* **Mercury Sea**
	* AoE CLD magic spell that targets MND
	* Chance to ATK-debuff(20): 100
	* Good for debuffing ATK specifically or dealing with trash, not much more
* **Omoikane's Device**
	* AoE MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Chance to MAG-debuff(20): 100
	* Good for debuffing MAG specifically or dealing with trash, not much more
* **Hourai Elixir**
	* Single target heal that cures 50% max HP
	* Heals all ailments and removes all debuffs
	* Eirin's most useful spell, which can overheal to 150% HP thanks to her skill
* **Astronomical Entombing**
	* AoE DRK magic spell that targets MND
	* Chance to HVY(20000): 100
	* Eirin's nuke that can also inflict HVY at a high success rate. Very powerful, but costly in MP and delay

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **HP/MAG/RES Boost**
	* RES Boost makes her pretty much immune to most ailments
* **Residents of Eientei**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 7/14 for each of Kaguya/Reisen also in front
	* All of Eientei is useful, so this skill is very good if you'll depend on all 3 of them
* **People of the Moon**
	* Ignore 50% of enemy DEF/MND, but every turn there's a 75% chance to lose 1MP
	* Eirin can use this to help her damage output against very tanky bosses, but 50% isn't that meaningful of a cut
* **Healing Limit Break**
	* Allows healing spells to go over the max HP
	* Eirin's best spell, allows characters to go 50% over their max HP with Hourai Elixir and greatly extend their longevity.
* **Cooling Down**
	* Concentrate at full HP multiplies MP recovered by 2/3
	* This helps immensely at keeping her supplied with MP for trash and prolonged boss fights, specially with People of the Moon eating 1 MP every now and then
* **Pharmacist's Poison Mixing**
	* Increases PSN chance by 25 and duration by 5000 for all moves
	* This can help Eirin stick some PSN on trash, but the effect is too weak to be useful
* **Thousand Year Exile**
	* Boosts SPD by 66% on the back line
	* Great fore restoring MP on the back line, but Cooling Down is generally more useful
