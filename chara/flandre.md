## Quick Summary

Flandre is completely optional, requiring several event detours, 60 achievements, 30 FOE kills and 300 BP on 4 characters to access, making her really time-consuming to recruit. She's a really strong glass cannon, with power nearly unmatched by other characters. Her spells can melt through bosses and trash's HP, but she needs a lot of support to avoid self-destructing, thanks to her spells' side effects.

	* DRK physical spell that targets DEF
	* Has -16 ACC
	* Flandre loses 40/38/36/34/32% of her max HP (cannot go below 1 HP)
	* Insane damage with not that big of a drawback, since Flandre herself is very frail
* **Forbidden Fruit**
	* AoE MYS magic spell that targets MND
	* Has +40 ACC
	* Consumes 1 MP from other frontliners, reduces their ATB by 10%
	* Very powerful, mostly useful for trash cleaning because of the ATB reduction

	* AoE FIR composite spell that targets DEF
	* Consumes 2 MP from other frontliners, reduces their ATB by 20%
	* Debuffs all frontliners' all stats by 10% - no resistances apply
	* Extremely powerful, mostly useful for trash cleaning because of the ATB reduction and debuffs

## <a id="skills"></a>Skills List

* **MP/ATK/MAG Boost**
	* Her basic stats to increase her damage-dealing potential
* **SDM Residents**
	* Buffs self ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 5/10 for each of Meiling/Patchy/Sakuya/Flandre also in front
	* Vital if using other SDM residents on the front line
* **Smoldering Madness**
	* Boosts front line's ATK by 4/8 every turn
	* Can help keep ATK buffs active if the party needs them, at least Flandre needs it
* **Impact AttackE**
	* Increases SHK chance by 25 for all moves
	* Nothing to stack on, but SHK is amazing against bosses that don't resist it, so very useful
* **Beat Down**
	* When Flandre kills something, restore 1/2 MP and buff ATK/DEF/MAG/MND/SPD by 8/16
	* Not exactly useful for Flandre since her spells are do-or-die, thanks to the side effects
* **Vampiric Wrath**
	* Buffs all stats by 25% if hit by an elemental weakness
	* If you can make Flandre survive the hit, this is really good
